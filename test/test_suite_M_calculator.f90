!   The programmer (generally) uses just the CALCULATOR(3f) routine or several
!   convenience routines (INUM0,RNUM0,SNUM0,STRGAR2,EXPRESSION) that simplify
!   making the most common type of calls to CALCULATOR(3f).
! 
!    PROCEDURES
!   •  [1]calculator The procedure CALCULATOR(3f) acts like a calculator
! 
!   •  [2]getvalue given numeric variable name return double precision value
!      directly
!

! 
!   •  [4]rgetvalue given numeric variable name return real value directly
! 
!   •  [5]stuff pass INTEGER|REAL|DOUBLEPRECISION value directly to calculator
!      dictionary
! 
!   •  [6]stuffa directly store a string into calculator variable name table
! 
!   •
! 
!    CONSTANTS
!   The variables used to hold the X,Y,$X $Y, ... arrays and the dictionaries of
!   variable names and string names and their associated values:
! 
!             + integer,parameter,public :: iclen_calc=512 ! max length of
!               expression or variable value as a string
!             + integer,parameter,public :: ixy_calc=55555 ! number of
!               variables in X() and Y() array
!             + integer,parameter,public :: icname_calc=20 ! max length of a
!               variable name
!             + real(kind=dp),save,public :: x(ixy_calc)=0.0_dp ! x array for
!               procedure funcs_
!             + real(kind=dp),save,public :: y(ixy_calc)=0.0_dp ! y array for
!               procedure funcs_
!             + integer,save,public,allocatable :: values_len(:) ! lengths of

!             + character(len=:),save,public,allocatable :: values(:) ! string
!               variable values
! 
!    LINKS
! 
!   •  The hierarchy of operations is the same as that of FORTRAN except that
!      adjacent exponents are done from left to right, not right to left [i.e.
!      in FORTRAN 3**2**4=3**(2**4), e.g. 3**2**4=(3**2)**4]; and +- strings are
!      resolved to a single sign (that is, 3+ -4 is acceptable instead of
!      3+(-4)).
!         Therefore, it is generally good practice to assume unquoted white-
!         space ends an expression.
! 
!      •        All numeric values are treated as FORTRAN type REAL variables.
! 
!      •        Input lines should not normally be over 255 characters long,
! 
!      •        There are three ways to store results to be used in future
!         calculations:
! 
!         1.  Variable names
! 
!         2.  The current-value
! 
!         3.  The x and y arrays Each of the types will be discussed separately.
! 
!    VARIABLE NAMES
!   Names must be 1 to 20 characters long, and are case-sensitive. The numbr of
!   names permitted is only limited by the available memory. Numeric variable
!   names should be composed of the letters a-z and underscores and numbers.
!   String variables are similar but start with a dollar sign($). Names must not
!   end in a "digit-E" combination. For example:
! 
!     A=sin(3.1416/2) big=200.333E200 $name="Thomas Jefferson"
! 
!                     Variables may be defined by equating them to an
!                     expression. To define or redefine a variable called FRED,
!                     simply enter:
! 
!     > FRED=300*4/500
! 
!                     The last value assigned to a variable will be used to
!                     evaluate the expression on the left of the equals sign
!                     when this expression redefines the variable. For example:
! 
!     > A=2 2 > A 2 > A=A+A 4 > A=A+A 8
! 
!                     To allow FORTRAN-type E-format numeric entry and yet not
!                     cause the calculator routine to do an excessive amount of
!                     checking, a variable name ending in the letter E must not
!                     have a digit (012345789) in front of that ending E.
!                     Attempting to define such a variable name will produce an
!                     error. This limitation prevents the calculator from
!                     becoming confused by whether 12E+3 is a variable called
!                     12E plus 3 or the exponential number 12E3=12000.
! 
!    CURRENT VALUE
!   The variable name '?' is automatically set by the program to contain the
!   last calculated value. This current-value register may be used like any
!   variable or number. It is 0 at program initialization. Example:
! 
!     > (300+500) 800 > (1/4)*?  200 > ?+?  400
! 
!    THE X AND Y ARRAYS
!   Two arrays called X and Y are available that can contain up to 55555 values
!   each. The arrays are originally initialized to all zeros. To set values in
!   the arrays, use the xstore (or ystore) command. The format of the commands
!   is
! 
!   xstore(start,ex1,ex2,ex3) ystore(start,ex1,ex2,ex3)
! 
!                   where start=array address to start storing at and ex(i)
!                   are expressions.
!                   The current value is assigned the last value stored.
!                   In addition there are similar string arrays and functions
!                   that can hold up to 50 255-character strings:
! 
!     •  $nstore(), $xstore(), $ystore()
! 
!     •  $n() ,$x() ,$y()
! 
!                     For example, to store into the locations 10,11,and 12 the
!                     values 1/10,2/10, and 3/10, the following could be
!                     entered:
! 
!     xstore( 10 , 1/10 , 2/20 , 3/10 ) ^ !  *-------Start storing evaluated
!     expressions sequentially, beginning at x(10).
! 
!    REFERENCING AN ARRAY VALUE
!   The values stored into the arrays may be referenced by subscript. For
!   example:
! 
!     > xstore(1,10,20,30) 30 > fred=x(1)+x(2)+x(3) 60
! 
!                     NOTES:
! 
!       1.  x and y array values cannot be used on the left of equal signs.
! 
!     x(10)=5
!       #  IS ILLEGAL
! 
!       2.  The current value is set to the value of the last expression by the
!           xstore and ystore commands
! 
!    INTRINSICS
!   supported Fortran intrinsics
! 
!                   The majority of intrinsic Fortran numeric functions are
!                   available. At a minimum the following are recognized
!                   (Deviations of the calculator routines from the standard
!                   intrinsics are noted):
! 
!   Arc or anti-trigonometric functions
! 
!                       # ACOS(arg) is a generic function that returns the
!                         arccosine of its argument in radians. The result of
!                         ACOS(real-arg) is real.
!                       # ASIN(arg) is a generic function that returns the
!                         arcsine of its argument in radians. The result of
!                         ASIN(real-arg) is real.
!                       # ATAN(arg) is a generic function that returns the
!                         arctangent of its argument in radians. The result of
!                         ATAN(real-arg) is real.
!                       # ATAN2(arg1, arg2) is a generic function that returns
!                         the arctangent of its argument in radians. The
!                         result of ATAN2(real-arg1, real-arg2) is real. The

!    MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS
!   Displaying variable values: dump The current value and all defined variable
!   names are displayed via the dump command.
! 
!   Listing Available Functions: funcs A display of all available functions can
!   be obtained when executing CALCULATOR(3f) by entering the command 'funcs'.
!   No descriptions are provided.
! 
! ADDING FUNCTIONS
!   Any program that calls CALCULATOR(3f) directly or indirectly (via
!   EXPRESSION(3f), STRGAR2(), INUM0(), RNUM0(), SNUM0()) can extend the
!   functions available by supplying two routines:
! 
!   1.  SUBSTITUTE_SUBROUTINE(3f) - This user-supplied routine is a hook for
!       programmers to add their own functions to CALCULATOR(3f) without having
!       to change CALCULATOR(3f) directly. It is passed the name of unknown
!       functions and their parameter lists if the expression 'ownmode(1)' is
!       passed to the calculator. If you do not need to add custom functions to
!       the calculator this is not required. A user-defined function call be
!       created and called with call set_mysub(SUBROUTINE_NAME) The routine must
!       be defined with an explicit interface available in the calling unit.
! 
!       2.  SUBSTITUTE_C(3f) - This user-supplied function is here to optimize
!           performance of a particular program and everyone else should
!           typically ignore it. In a special case a non-standard function
!           needed added that was called so heavily that it was important that
!           it be called more efficiently than a user defined function placed in
!           SUBSTITUTE_SUBROUTINE(3f) is. It allows for the function "c" to be
!           defined and given an array and an array size as arguments. By
!           default the "c" function just returns zero. A replacement can be
!           defined by creating a function with similar arguments and calling
!           call set_myfunc(FUNCTION_NAME). The routine must be defined with an
!           explicit interface available in the calling unit.
! 
!   The following program shows a simple but complete line-mode calculator
!   program.
! 
!     ./compute
!       # run example program a=10 a/2 3**4 sin(3.1416/4) PI=2*asin(1)
!       diameter=20.3+8/4 circumference=PI*diameter funcs dump # use end-of-file
!       (typically control-D) to exit program ctrl-D
