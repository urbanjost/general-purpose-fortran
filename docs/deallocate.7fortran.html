     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The DEALLOCATE statement causes allocatable variables to be deallocated;
it causes pointer targets to be deallocated and the pointers to be
disassociated.
<P>
An allocate-object shall not depend on the value, bounds, allocation
status, or association status of another allocate-object in the same
DEALLOCATE statement; it also shall not depend on the value of the
stat-variable or errmsg-variable in the same DEALLOCATE statement.
<P>
The status of objects that were not successfully allocated or
deallocated can be individually checked with the intrinsic functions
ALLOCATED or ASSOCIATED.

<TABLE cellpadding=3>

Each allocate-object is a nonprocedure
pointer or an allocatable variable.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>STAT=stat-variable</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
If the STAT= specifier appears, successful
execution of the ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE
statement causes the stat-variable
to become defined with a value of zero.
<P>
If an error condition occurs during
execution of a DEALLOCATE statement that
does not contain the STAT= specifier, error
termination is initiated.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>ERRMSG=errmsg-variable</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
If an error condition occurs during execution
of an ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement, the
processor assigns an explanatory message to
errmsg-variable. If no such condition occurs,
the processor does not change the value of
the errmsg-variable.
</TD></TR>

<P>
No dealloc-opt shall appear more than once in a given DEALLOCATE statement
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The errmsg-variable and stat-variable cannot be allocated or
deallocated elsewhere in the statement or otherwise depend of any
allocatable object in the statement.

     <H3>DEALLOCATION OF ALLOCATABLE VARIABLES</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Deallocating an unallocated allocatable variable causes an error
condition in the DEALLOCATE statement. Deallocating an allocatable
variable with the TARGET attribute causes the pointer association
status of any pointer associated with it to become undefined.
<P>
When the execution of a procedure is terminated by execution of a
RETURN or END statement, an unsaved allocatable local variable of
the procedure retains its allocation and definition status if it
is a function result variable or a subobject thereof; otherwise,
it is deallocated.
<P>
When a BLOCK construct terminates, an unsaved allocatable local
variable of the construct is deallocated.
<P>
If an executable construct references a function whose result is either
allocatable or a structure with a subobject that is allocatable,
and the function reference is executed, an allocatable result and
any subobject that is an allocated allocatable entity in the result
returned by the function is deallocated after execution of the
innermost executable construct containing the reference.
<P>
If a function whose result is either allocatable or a structure with
an allocatable subobject is referenced in the specification part
of a scoping unit or BLOCK construct, and the function reference
is executed, an allocatable result and any subobject that is an
allocated allocatable entity in the result returned by the function
is deallocated before execution of the executable constructs of the
scoping unit or block.
<P>
When a procedure is invoked, any allocated allocatable object that
is an actual argument corresponding to an INTENT (OUT) allocatable
dummy argument is deallocated; any allocated allocatable object that
is a subobject of an actual argument corresponding to an INTENT (OUT)
dummy argument is deallocated.
<P>
When an intrinsic assignment statement (7.2.1.3) is executed,
any noncoarray allocated allocatable subobject of the variable is
deallocated before the assignment takes place.
<P>
When a variable of derived type is deallocated, any allocated
allocatable subobject is deallocated.
<P>
If an allocatable component is a subobject of a finalizable object,
that object is finalized before the component is automatically
deallocated.
<P>
The effect of automatic deallocation is the same as that of a
DEALLOCATE statement without a dealloc-opt-list.
<P>
There is implicit synchronization of all images in association with
each DEALLOCATE statement that deallocates one or more coarrays. On
each image, execution of the segment (8.5.1) following the statement
is delayed until all other images have executed the same statement
the same number of times. If the coarray is a dummy argument, its
ultimate argument (12.5.2.3) shall be the same coarray on every image.
<P>
There is also an implicit synchronization of all images in association
with the deallocation of a coarray or coarray subcomponent caused by
the execution of a RETURN or END statement or the termination of a
BLOCK construct.
<P>
<PRE>
    In the following example:
<P>
       &gt; SUBROUTINE PROCESS
       &gt;   REAL, ALLOCATABLE :: TEMP(:)
       &gt;
       &gt;   REAL, ALLOCATABLE, SAVE :: X(:)
       &gt;   &#46;&#46;&#46;
       &gt; END SUBROUTINE PROCESS
<P>
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
on return from subroutine PROCESS, the allocation status of X is
preserved because X has the SAVE attribute. TEMP does not have the
SAVE attribute, so it will be deallocated if it was allocated. On
the next invocation of PROCESS, TEMP will have an allocation status
of unallocated.

     <H3>DEALLOCATION OF POINTER TARGETS</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If a pointer appears in a DEALLOCATE statement, its association status
shall be defined. Deallocating a pointer
that is disassociated or whose target was not created by an ALLOCATE
statement causes an error condition in the DEALLOCATE statement. If a
pointer is associated with an allocatable entity, the pointer shall
not be deallocated.
<P>
If a pointer appears in a DEALLOCATE statement, it shall be associated
with the whole of an object that was
created by allocation. Deallocating a pointer target causes the
pointer association status of any other pointer that is associated
with the target or a portion of the target to become undefined.
<P>
If an ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement with a coarray
allocate-object is executed when one or more images has initiated
termination of execution, the stat-variable becomes defined with the
processor-dependent positive integer value of the constant STAT STOPPED
IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2). If any other
error condition occurs during execution of the ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE
statement, the stat-variable becomes defined with a processor-dependent
positive integer value different from STAT STOPPED IMAGE. In either
case, each allocate-object has a processor-dependent status:
