     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You may split almost all free-format Fortran statements into multiple
lines by inserting the sequence "&\n&", where "\n" represents a newline.
That is, split the line into two lines and place an ampersand at the
right end of the first line and as the first (non-space) character in
the second line.
<P>
You CANNOT split a comment or an INCLUDE pre-processor directive onto
multiple lines using this syntax.
<P>
The rule for commenting continued lines is simple, really. Comments can
go in the same places on continued lines as on non-continued lines
accept they cannot appear after the right-hand "&" when continuing a
long string.
<P>
So applying the general rule the line
<P>
<PRE>
      integer,save :: xx(2,3)= reshape([ 1,2,3,4,5,6 ],shape(xx),order=[2,1])
<P>
</PRE>
may be split into many lines by simple repeated application of the rule:
<P>
<PRE>
        integer,save :: xx(2,3)= reshape([&
        & 1, 2, 3,  &
        & 4, 5, 6   &
        &],shape(xx),order=[2,1])
<P>
</PRE>
Of course, when used for continuation the "&" is not part of the
equivalent concatenated statement.
<P>
That is basically it for the general rule, but there are a few variants
and details to cover.
<P>
When a line is split using the general rule any trailing spaces before
the amersand at the end of the line are included in the equivalent
single-line statement.
<P>
However, spaces before the ampersand beginning the second line are
ignored. So you can indent the lines beginning with an ampersand any way
you like:
<P>
<PRE>
        integer,save :: xx(2,3)= reshape([&
             & 1, 2, 3, &
             & 4, 5, 6  &
        &],shape(xx),order=[2,1])
<P>
</PRE>
Now it ends up the leading ampersand is actually optional if not
splitting a lexical token or constant numeric or string value (which is
generally not recommended anyway). If not present the result is the same
as if an ampersand were inserted as the first character of the line --
so the leading spaces are significant when the leading ampersand is
absent. When not splitting strings multiple spaces generally are treated
the same as a single space so this is equivalent to the previous
example:
<P>
<PRE>
        integer,save :: xx(2,3)= reshape([ &
               1, 2, 3,                    &
               4, 5, 6                     &
        ],shape(xx),order=[2,1])
<P>

     <H3>COMMENTS ON COMMENTING CONTINUED LINES</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
First, note you cannot continue a comment onto another line. An "&" in a
comment is treated like any other character, with no special effect
(Just start an additional comment line if you want a comment to appear
across multiple lines).
<P>
That being said, comments themselves may occur as individual lines
inbetween sections of a continued statement, or after the ending
ampersand IF NOT CONTINUING A STRING CONSTANT.
<P>
So lets add an explanation about the continued line using in-line
comments, comment lines and blank lines:
<P>
<PRE>
        integer,save :: xx(2,3)= reshape([& ! define array in row-column order
<P>
           !===========!
           & 1, 2, 3,  &   ! row 1
           & 4, 5, 6   &   ! row 2
           !===========!
<P>
        ],shape(xx),order=[2,1])
<P>
</PRE>
So trailing comments are allowed on non-character continuations, and
comment lines and blank lines are always allowed.
<P>
Note no line shall contain a single "&" as the only nonblank character
or as the only nonblank character before an ! that initiates a comment.
<P>
you have to have the leading amersand on continued lines when splitting
quoted strings or lexical words or constant values.
<P>
But try to never split constants or lexical words!
<P>
<PRE>
        character(len=*),parameter :: str1=&#146;my first str&#146;,str2=&#146;my second str&#146;
<P>
</PRE>
could be written as
<P>
<PRE>
        char&
        &acter(len=*), para&
        &meter :: str1=&#146;my fi&
        &rst str&#146;, str2=&#146;my se&
        &cond str&#146;
<P>
</PRE>
where things were split in two in a haphazard way as long as no spaces
are introduced before the ending amersand and after the leading amersand
that would make the statement illegal if all appearing on one line
(ignoring length for the moment).
<P>
This is a more realistic example (a very long string):
<P>
<PRE>
       character(len=*),parameter=&#146;this is a really long string &
         &that I needed to put onto several lines because it would be&
         & so long if I left it on a single line that it might be longer&
         & than allowed in older compilers and would certainly not fit &
         &in my favorite 80-column&
         & terminal window&#146;

     <H3>HOW LONG YOU CAN CONTINUE</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Since we are talking about very long lines, how long can a single
statement be? In the Fortran 95 standard, only a maximum of 39
continuation lines is required to be conformant. In Fortran 2003 and
Fortran 2008, at least 255 is to be allowed. There is no limit specified
in Fortran 2018. See your compiler documentation to see if your compiler
still has a limit, but it is probably at least a few hundred lines.

     <H3>FIXED FORMAT AND INCLUDE FILES</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
NOTE: Skip this session if you do not need to deal with (typically old)
fixed-format Fortran files.
<P>
Fixed-format Fortran has a very different continuation rule where the
first line has nothing added to it except an optional zero in column six
and all continuations have a non-space non-zero character that is part
of the Fortran character set in column six. If a quoted string is broken
the first line acts as if padded with spaces out to column 72.
<P>
Even though the rules for continueing statements on multiple lines are
so different, source code can be formatted in a format that works in
both free and fixed-format files.
<P>
Other than being just a curiosity, this is useful if an INCLUDE file is
needed by both free and fixed-format files. (Note that INCLUDE
statements themselves are one of the few statements that cannot be split
across multiple lines!).
<P>
So here is how to make an INCLUDE file for both fixed and free-format
files:
<TABLE cellpadding=3><!-- tsb: So here is how to make an INCLUDE file for both fixed and free-format
 -->
<TR></TR><TR></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=3%>
o
</TD><TD>
ConÔ¨Åne statement labels to character positions 1 to 5 and statements
to character positions 7 to 72, which is a requirement of
fixed-format.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=3%>
o
</TD><TD>
Treat blanks as being significant, which they are in free-format.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=3%>
o
</TD><TD>
Use only the exclamation mark (!) to indicate a comment, but do not
start the comment in character position 6.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=3%>
o
</TD><TD>
For continued statements, place an ampersand (&) in both character
position 73 of a continued line and character position 6 of a
continuation line.
</TD></TR>
<TR></TR></TABLE>Why does this work?
<P>
If every line being continued has an ampersand in column 73 or further
the ampersand will be ignored by standard fixed-format Fortran.
<P>
Combined with the second ampersand always present and in column six for
all but the first line both rules for free and fixed source files are
satisfied.
<P>
Fixed-format can use most printable characters in column 6 to indication
continuation. One of the allowed characters is "&", which is the one and
only character used by free-format. So using it obeys both rules.
<P>
Therefore the following is equivalent in fixed and free-format parsing:
<P>
<PRE>
     &gt;12345 continue
     &gt;      character(len=*),parameter :: string1="hello world",string2="hel&
     &gt;     &lo world"
<P>
</PRE>
Obviously, this is not compatible with extended length fixed-format
source files (which some compilers support as an extension) unless the
ampersand is shifted beyond the extended limit (which in standard
fixed-format files would be past column 72).
<P>
You may want to look for a compiler option to disable long-line warnings
when using characters past column 72.
