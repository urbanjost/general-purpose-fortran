     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Creates a new watch group and returns a handle for it.
A watch group must be created by this routine before it
is passed to any other M_StopWatch routines.  In Fortran
90 it is impossible to test whether or not a watch
group has been created, and using a watch group that
has not been created may cause the program to crash.
It is not an error to create a watch group that has
already been created, however the prior information and
memory locations will be lost.  Watch groups should be
destroyed (see
<B>destroy_watchgroup</B>(3))
before they are recreated.  Also, local variable watch
groups should be destroyed before returning from a
subroutine, to avoid memory leaks.
<P>
One or more watches may be optionally specified.  If
<I>watch</I> is present, the watch group will initially contain the
specified watch(es).  If
<I>watch</I> is omitted, the watch group will initially be empty.
Watches can be added and removed from the group with
<B>join_watchgroup</B> and
<B>leave_watchgroup.</B> The argument
<I>watch</I> can be a single variable of type
<I>watchtype</I> (see
<B>M_stopwatch</B>(3))
to start the group with one watch, or an array of type
<I>watchtype</I> to start the group with several watches.
<P>
The argument
<I>handle</I> is a variable of type
<I>watchgroup</I> that will subsequently be used to access the watch
group.

     <H3>DIAGNOSTICS</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If present, the optional intent OUT integer argument
<I>err</I> returns a status code.  The code is the sum of the
values listed below.
<P>
An error message will be printed to a specified I/O
unit (unit 6 by default) if
<I>print_errors</I> is TRUE (default is TRUE). The error message contains
more detail about the cause of the error than can be
obtained from just the status code, so you should set
<I>print_errors</I> to TRUE if you have trouble determining the cause of
the error.
<P>
If
<I>abort_errors</I> is TRUE (default is FALSE), the program will terminate
on an error condition.  Otherwise, the program will
continue execution but the watch group will not be
created.
<P>
See
<B>option_stopwatch</B>(3)
for further information on
<I>print_errors, abort_errors</I> and I/O units.
<P>
The relevant status codes and messages are:

No errors; execution successful.

</TD><TD>
Watch needs to be created.  This error occurs if you
attempt to put a watch that has been destroyed in the
group.  The watch must first be created again.  See
also the comment about watches that have never been
created in the BUGS section.

Failed to allocate required memory.  When a group is
created, memory is allocated for the group.  Also, when
<B>create_watchgroup</B> is called with an array of watches, temporary memory is
allocated.  This error occurs if the Fortran
<B>allocate</B> statement returns a nonzero status indicating that
memory could not be allocated.  Avoid memory leaks by
always destroying watches and groups before recreating
them, and destroying local variable watches and groups
before returning from a subroutine.

Error occurred while deallocating memory.  This error
occurs if the Fortran
<B>deallocate</B> statement returns a nonzero status while deallocating
temporary memory used for an array of watches.  The
group is created, but be aware that other problems
could develop as a result of the deallocate error.

<P>
call create_watchgroup(handle=g1)

<I>g2</I> with three watches, and returns a status code.

     <H3>BUGS</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It cannot be determined whether or not a watch variable
has been created (passed as an argument to
<B>create_watch).</B> If a watch that has never been created is passed into
<B>create_watchgroup,</B> it might generate a Fortran error due to passing a
pointer with undefined association status to the
Fortran intrinsic function
<B>associated.</B> However, some compilers will allow this as an extension
to the Fortran 90 standard and recognize that the
pointer is not associated, in which case the &#145;&#145;Watch
needs to be created&#146;&#146; error message is generated.
