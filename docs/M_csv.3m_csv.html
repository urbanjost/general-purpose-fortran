     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Standard RFC 4180
<P>
In computing, a comma-<I>separated</I> values (CSV) file stores tabular
data (numbers and text) in plain text. Each line of the file is a
data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, <I>separated</I> by
commas. The use of the comma <I>as</I> a <I>field</I> separator is the source of the
name for this file format.
<P>
The CSV file format is not standardized. The basic idea of separating
fields with a comma is clear, but that idea gets complicated when the
<I>field</I> data may also contain commas or even embedded line-breaks. CSV
implementations may not handle such <I>field</I> data, or they may use quotation
marks to surround the <I>field</I>. Quotation does not solve everything: some
fields may need embedded quotation marks, so a CSV implementation may
include escape characters or escape sequences.
<P>
In addition, the term "CSV" also denotes some closely related
delimiter-<I>separated</I> formats that use different <I>field</I> delimiters. These
include tab-<I>separated</I> values and space-<I>separated</I> values. A delimiter that
is not present in the <I>field</I> data (such <I>as</I> tab) keeps the format parsing
simple. These alternate delimiter-<I>separated</I> files are often even given a
terminology can cause problems in data exchange. Many applications that
accept CSV files have options to select the delimiter character and the
quotation character.

     <H3>DATA EXCHANGE</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
CSV is a common data exchange format that is widely supported by
consumer, business, and scientific applications. Among its most common
uses is moving tabular data between programs that natively operate on
incompatible (often proprietary or undocumented) formats.[1] This works
despite lack of adherence to RFC 4180 (or any other standard), because
so many programs support variations on the CSV format for data import.
<P>
For example, a user may need to transfer <I>information</I> from a <B>database</B>
program that stores data in a proprietary format, to a spreadsheet that
uses a completely different format. The <B>database</B> program most likely can
export its data <I>as</I> "CSV"; the exported CSV file can then be imported by
the spreadsheet program.

     <H3>SPECIFICATION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
RFC 4180 proposes a specification for the CSV format, and this is the
definition commonly used. However, in popular usage "CSV" is not a
single, well-defined format. As a result, in practice the term "CSV"
might refer to any file that:[2][5]

<TR valign=top><TD width=4%>

</TD><TD>
where every record has the same sequence of fields.
</TD></TR>
<TR></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Within these general constraints, many variations are in use. Therefore,
without additional <I>information</I> (such <I>as</I> whether RFC 4180 is honored),
a file claimed simply to be in "CSV" format is not fully specified. As a
result, many applications supporting CSV files allow users to preview the
first few lines of the file and then specify the delimiter <B>character</B>(s),
quoting rules, etc. If a particular CSV file&#146;s variations fall outside
what a particular receiving program supports, it is often feasible to
examine and edit the file by hand (i.e., with a text editor) or write
a script or program to produce a conforming format.

     <H3>HISTORY</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Comma-<I>separated</I> values is a data format that pre-dates personal computers
by more than a decade: the IBM Fortran (level H extended) compiler
under OS/360 supported them in 1972.[6] List-directed ("free form")
input/output was defined in FORTRAN 77, approved in 1978. List-directed
input used commas or spaces for delimiters, so unquoted character strings
could not contain commas or spaces.[7]
<P>
The "comma-<I>separated</I> value" name and "CSV" abbreviation appear to
have come into common use in 1983, in connection with the SuperCalc
spreadsheet.[8]. The manual for the Osborne Executive computer, which
bundled SuperCalc, documents the CSV quoting convention that allows
strings to contain embedded commas, but does not specify a convention
for embedding quotation marks within quoted strings.[9]
<P>
Comma-<I>separated</I> value <I>lists</I> are easier to type (for example into punched
cards) than fixed-column-aligned data, and were less prone to producing
incorrect results if a value was punched one column off from its intended
location.
<P>
Comma <I>separated</I> files are used for the interchange of <B>database</B> <I>information</I>
between machines of two different architectures. The plain-text character
of CSV files largely avoids incompatibilities such <I>as</I> byte-order and word
size. The files are largely human-readable, so it is easier to deal with
them in the absence of perfect documentation or communication.[10]
<P>
The main standardization initiative transforming "de facto fuzzy
definition" into a more precise and de jure one was in 2005, with
RFC4180, defining CSV <I>as</I> a MIME Content Type. Later, in 2013, some of
RFC4180&#146;s deficiencies were tackled by a W3C recommendation.[11]
<P>
In 2014 IETF published RFC7111 describing application of URI fragments
to CSV documents. RFC7111 specifies how row, column, and cell ranges
can be selected from a CSV document using position indexes.
<P>
In 2015 W3C, in an attempt to enhance CSV with formal semantics,
publicized the first drafts of recommendations for CSV-metadata standards,
that began <I>as</I> recommendations in December of the same year.[12]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=6>

     <H3>GENERAL FUNCTIONALITY</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
CSV formats are best used to represent sets or sequences of records
in which each record has an identical list of fields. This corresponds
to a single relation in a relational <B>database</B>, or to data (though not
calculations) in a typical spreadsheet.
<P>
The format dates back to the early days of business computing and is
widely used to pass data between computers with different internal word
sizes, data formatting needs, and so forth. For this reason, CSV files
are common on all computer platforms.
<P>
CSV is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values (many
implementations of CSV import/export tools allow other separators to
be used). Simple CSV implementations may prohibit <I>field</I> values that
contain a comma or other special characters such <I>as</I> newlines. More
sophisticated CSV implementations permit them, often by requiring "
(double quote) characters around values that contain reserved characters
(such <I>as</I> commas, double quotes, or less commonly, newlines). Embedded
double quote characters may then be represented by a pair of consecutive
double quotes,[13] or by prefixing an escape character such <I>as</I> a backslash
(for example in Sybase Central).
<P>
CSV formats are not limited to a particular character set.[1] They work
just <I>as</I> well with Unicode character sets (such <I>as</I> UTF-8 or UTF-16) <I>as</I>
with ASCII (although particular programs that support CSV may have their
own limitations). CSV files normally will even survive naive translation
from one character set to another (unlike nearly all proprietary data
formats). CSV does not, however, provide any way to indicate what
character set is in use, so that must be communicated separately, or
determined at the receiving end (if possible).
<P>
Databases that include multiple relations cannot be exported <I>as</I> a single CSV file.
<P>
Similarly, CSV cannot naturally represent hierarchical or object-oriented
<B>database</B> or other data. This is because every CSV record is expected
to have the same structure. CSV is therefore rarely appropriate for
documents such <I>as</I> those created with HTML, XML, or other markup or
word-processing technologies.
<P>
Statistical databases in various fields often have a generally
relation-like structure, but with some repeatable groups of fields. For
example, health databases such <I>as</I> the Demographic and Health Survey
typically repeat some questions for each child of a given parent (perhaps
up to a fixed maximum number of children). Statistical analysis systems
often include utilities that can "rotate" such data; for example, a
"parent" record that includes <I>information</I> about five children can be
split into five separate records, each containing (a) the <I>information</I> on
one child, and (b) a copy of all the non-child-specific <I>information</I>. CSV
can represent either the "vertical" or "horizontal" form of such data.
<P>
In a relational <B>database</B>, similar issues are readily handled by creating
a separate relation for each such group, and connecting "child" records
to the related "parent" records using a foreign key (such <I>as</I> an ID
number or name for the parent). In markup languages such <I>as</I> XML, such
groups are typically enclosed within a parent element and repeated <I>as</I>
necessary (for example, multiple &lt;child&gt; nodes within a single &lt;parent&gt;
node). With CSV there is no widely accepted single-file solution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=7>

     <H3>STANDARDIZATION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The name "CSV" indicates the use of the comma to separate data
fields. Nevertheless, the term "CSV" is widely used to refer a large
family of formats, which differ in many ways. Some implementations
allow or require single or double quotation marks around some or all
fields; and some reserve the very first record <I>as</I> a header containing
a list of <I>field</I> names. The character set being used is undefined: some
applications require a Unicode byte order mark (BOM) to enforce Unicode
interpretation (sometimes even a UTF-8 BOM).[1] Files that use the tab
character instead of comma can be more precisely referred to <I>as</I> "TSV"
for tab-<I>separated</I> values.
<P>
Other implementation differences include handling of more commonplace
<I>field</I> separators (such <I>as</I> space or semicolon) and newline characters
inside text fields. One more subtlety is the interpretation of a blank
line: it can equally be the result of writing a record of zero fields,
or a record of one <I>field</I> of zero length; thus decoding it is ambiguous.
<P>
Reliance on the standard documented by RFC 4180 can simplify
CSV exchange. However, this standard only specifies handling of
text-based fields. Interpretation of the text of each <I>field</I> is still
application-specific.
<P>
RFC 4180 formalized CSV. It defines the MIME type "text/csv", and
CSV files that follow its rules should be very widely portable. Among
its requirements: MS-DOS-style lines that end with (CR/LF) characters
(optional for the last line). An optional header record (there is no sure
way to detect whether it is present, so care is required when importing).
Each record "should" contain the same number of comma-<I>separated</I> fields.
Any <I>field</I> may be quoted (with double quotes). Fields containing a
line-break, double-quote or commas should be quoted. (If they are not, the
file will likely be impossible to process correctly). A (double) quote
character in a <I>field</I> must be represented by two (double) quote characters.
<P>
The format can be processed by most programs that claim to read CSV
files. The exceptions are: (a) programs may not support line-breaks
within quoted fields, (b) programs may confuse the optional header with
data or interpret the first data line <I>as</I> an optional header and (c)
double quotes in a <I>field</I> may not be parsed correctly automatically.
<P>
In 2011 Open Knowledge and various partners created a data protocols
working group, which later evolved into the Frictionless Data
initiative. One of the main formats they released was Tabular Data
Package. Tabular Data package was heavily based on CSV, using it <I>as</I> the
main data transport format and adding basic type and schema metadata
(CSV lacks any type <I>information</I> to distinguish the string "1" from the
number 1). An initial v1 of Tabular Data Package was released in 2015,
and after extensive real-world testing and tool development, v1 of a
CSV-based Tabular Data Package was officially released in September
2017.[14] The Frictionless Data Initiative has also provided a standard
CSV Dialect Description Format for describing different dialects of CSV,
for example specifying the <I>field</I> separator or quoting rules.
<P>
In 2013 the W3C "CSV on the Web" working group began to specify
technologies providing a higher interoperability for web applications
using CSV or similar formats.[15] The working group completed its work in
February 2016, and is officially closed in March 2016 with the release
of a set documents and W3C recommendations[16] for modeling "Tabular
Data",[17] and enhancing CSV with metadata and semantics.

     <H3>BASIC RULES</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Many informal documents exist that describe "CSV" formats. IETF RFC
4180 (summarized above) defines the format for the "text/csv" MIME type
registered with the IANA.
<P>
Rules typical of these and other "CSV" specifications and implementations
are <I>as</I> follows: CSV is a delimited data format that has fields/columns
<I>separated</I> by the comma character and records/rows terminated by
newlines. A CSV file does not require a specific character encoding,
byte order, or line terminator format (some software does not support
all line-end variations). A record ends at a line terminator. However,
line-terminators can be embedded <I>as</I> data within fields, so software
must recognize quoted line-separators (see below) in order to correctly
assemble an entire record from perhaps multiple lines. All records should
have the same number of fields, in the same order. Data within fields
is interpreted <I>as</I> a sequence of characters, not <I>as</I> a sequence of bits
or bytes (see RFC 2046, section 4.1). For example, the numeric quantity
65535 may be represented <I>as</I> the 5 ASCII characters "65535" (or perhaps
other forms such <I>as</I> "0xFFFF", "000065535.000E+00", etc.); but not <I>as</I> a
sequence of 2 bytes intended to be treated <I>as</I> a single binary integer
rather than <I>as</I> two characters (e.g. the numbers 11264-11307 have a comma
<I>as</I> their high order byte: <B>ord</B>(&#146;,&#146;)*256..<B>ord</B>(&#146;,&#146;)*257-1). If this "plain
text" convention is not followed, then the CSV file no longer contains
sufficient <I>information</I> to interpret it correctly, the CSV file will not
likely survive transmission across differing computer architectures,
and will not conform to the text/csv MIME type. Adjacent fields must be
<I>separated</I> by a single comma. However, "CSV" formats vary greatly in this
choice of separator character. In particular, in locales where the comma
is used <I>as</I> a decimal separator, semicolon, TAB, or other characters are
used instead. 1997,Ford,E350

Any <I>field</I> may be quoted (that is, enclosed within double-quote
characters). Some fields must be quoted, <I>as</I> specified in following rules.

The latter format is not RFC 4180 compliant.[18] Compliance could be
achieved by the use of a comma instead of a semicolon <I>as</I> a separator and
either the international notation for the representation of the decimal
mark or the practice of quoting all numbers that have a decimal mark.

     <H3>APPLICATION SUPPORT</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Main article: CSV application support
<P>
The CSV file format is supported by almost all spreadsheets and <B>database</B>
management systems. Many programming languages have libraries available
that support CSV files. Many implementations support changing the
<I>field</I>-separator character and some quoting conventions, although it
is safest to use the simplest conventions, to maximize the recipients&#146;
chances of handling the data.
<P>
Microsoft Excel will open .csv files, but depending on the system&#146;s
regional settings, it may expect a semicolon <I>as</I> a separator instead
of a comma, since in some languages the comma is used <I>as</I> the decimal
separator. Excel supports the use of a "sep= " row at the beginning of the
file to change the expected delimiter (example: sep=; will cause Excel
to use ";" <I>as</I> the delimiter). Excel also applies some additional data
manipulations, such <I>as</I> reformatting what looks like numbers or dates,
eliminating leading + or 0, which breaks phone numbers, or a leading =
makes the cell a formula, where function names must be in the opener&#146;s
local language. Also, many regional versions of Excel will not be able
to deal with Unicode in CSV. One simple solution when encountering such
difficulties is to change the filename extension from .csv to .txt; then
opening the file from an already running Excel instance with the "Open"
command, where the user can manually specify the delimiters, encoding,
format of columns, etc.
<P>
Apache OpenOffice Calc and LibreOffice Calc handle CSV files and pasted
text with a Text Import dialog asking the user to manually specify the
delimiters, encoding, format of columns, etc.
<P>
Numbers (spreadsheet), the Apple equivalent of Microsoft Excel, supports
import and export of CSV files <I>as</I> well. In fact, this feature is one
that can be expected on almost any spreadsheet editing program.
<P>
There are many utility programs on Unix-style systems that can deal with
at least some CSV files. Many such utilities have a way to change the
delimiter character, but lack support for any other variations (or for
Unicode). Some of the useful programs are:
<P>
<PRE>
   column (-s to change the delimiter character(s))
   cut (-d to change the delimiter character)
