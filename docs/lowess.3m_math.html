     <H3>PURPOSE</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Lowess is a data analysis technique for producing a "smooth" set of
values from a time series which has been contaminated with noise,
or from a scatter plot with a "noisy" relationship between the two
variables. In a time series context, the technique is an improvement
over least squares smoothing when the data is not equally spaced
(as least squares smoothing assumes).

     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
LOWESS stands for "locally weighted regression". LOWESS computes the
smooth of a scatterplot of Y against X using robust locally weighted
regression. Fitted values, YS, are computed at each of the values of
the horizontal axis in X.
<P>
For lowess smoothing, the analyst can vary the size of the smoothing
window. This size is given as the fraction (0 to 1) of the data that
the window should cover. The default window size is .2 (which states
that the smoothing window has a total width of 20% of the horizontal
axis variable). The LOWESS fraction (F) controls the smoothness of the
curve. For example, if it is 1.0, then the LOWESS curve is a single
straight line. In general, the smaller the fraction, the more that
LOWESS curve follows individual data points. To obtain a smoother
LOWESS curve, increase the value of the LOWESS FRACTION.
<P>
This package consists of two FORTRAN procedures for smoothing
scatterplots by robust locally weighted regression, or lowess. The
principal routine is LOWESS which computes the smoothed values using
the method described in "The Elements of Graphing Data", by William S.
Cleveland (Wadsworth, 555 Morego Street, Monterey, California 93940).
<P>
LOWESS calls a support routine, LOWEST, the code for which is
included. LOWESS also calls a routine SORT, which the user must provide.
<P>
To reduce the computations, LOWESS requires that the arrays X and Y,
which are the horizontal and vertical coordinates, respectively, of the
scatterplot, be such that X is sorted from smallest to largest. The
user must therefore use another sort routine which will sort X and Y
according to X.
<P>
To summarize the scatterplot, YS, the fitted values, should be plotted
against X. No graphics routines are available in the package and must
be supplied by the user.
<P>
The FORTRAN code for the routines LOWESS and LOWEST has been generated
from higher level RATFOR programs (B. W. Kernighan, &#145;&#145;RATFOR: A
Preprocessor for a Rational Fortran,&#146;&#146; Software Practice and Experience,
Vol. 5 (1975).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
DELTA can be used to save computations.
Very roughly the algorithm is this:
on the initial fit and on each of the NSTEPS iterations locally weighted regression fitted values are computed
at points in X which are spaced, roughly, DELTA apart;
then the fitted values at the remaining points are computed using linear interpolation.
The first locally weighted regression (LWR) computation is carried out at X(1) and the last is carried out at X(N).
Suppose the LWR computation is carried out at X(I).
If X(I+1) is greater than or equal to X(I)+DELTA, the next LWR computation is carried out at X(I+1).
If X(I+1) is less than X(I)+DELTA, the next LWR computation is carried out at the largest X(J) which is greater than
or equal to X(I) but is not greater than X(I)+DELTA.
Then the fitted values for X(K) between X(I) and X(J), if there are any, are computed by linear interpolation
of the fitted values at X(I) and X(J).
If N is less than 100 then DELTA can be set to 0.0 since the computation time will not be too great.
For larger N it is typically not necessary to carry out the LWR computation for all points,
so that much computation time can be saved by taking DELTA to be greater than 0.0.
If DELTA = Range (X)/k then,
if the values in X were uniformly scattered over the range,
the full LWR computation would be carried out at approximately k points.
Taking k to be 50 often works well.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; METHOD</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The fitted values are computed by using the nearest neighbor
routine and robust locally weighted regression of degree 1
with the tricube weight function. A few additional features
have been added. Suppose r is FN truncated to an integer.
Let h be the distance to the r-th nearest neighbor
from X(I). All points within h of X(I) are used. Thus if
the r-th nearest neighbor is exactly the same distance as
other points, more than r points can possibly be used for
the smooth at X(I). There are two cases where robust
locally weighted regression of degree 0 is actually used at
X(I). One case occurs when h is 0.0. The second case
occurs when the weighted standard error of the X(I) with
respect to the weights w(j) is less than .001 times the
range of the X(I), where w(j) is the weight assigned to the
j-th point of X (the tricube weight times the robustness
weight) divided by the sum of all of the weights. Finally,
if the w(j) are all zero for the smooth at X(I), the fitted
value is taken to be Y(I).

LOWEST is a support routine for LOWESS and ordinarily will
not be called by the user. The fitted value, YS, is
computed at the value, XS, of the horizontal axis.
Robustness weights, RW, can be employed in computing the
fit.

The smooth at XS is computed using (robust) locally weighted
regression of degree 1. The tricube weight function is used
with h equal to the maximum of XS-X(NLEFT) and X(NRIGHT)<B>-XS</B>.
Two cases where the program reverts to locally weighted
regression of degree 0 are described in the documentation
for LOWESS.
