     <H3>SYNOPSIS</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
M_StopWatch is a Fortran 90 module for measuring
execution time of program segments.  M_StopWatch is
designed to be a portable, easy-to-use means of
measuring execution time.  It supports the wall clock,
CPU clock, and a breakdown of the CPU clock into user and
system times. It returns all times in seconds.  It
provides a simple means of determining which clocks are
available, and the precision of those clocks.
<P>
M_StopWatch is used by instrumenting your code with
subroutine calls that mimic the operation of a stop
watch.  The primary routines are
<B>start_watch, stop_watch, reset_watch, read_watch,</B> and
<B>print_watch.</B> M_StopWatch supports multiple watches, and provides the
concept of watch groups to allow functions to operate
on multiple watches simultaneously.

     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The entities in M_StopWatch that have public
accessibility are two derived types and fifteen
subroutines (one of which is a function subroutine).
Any program unit that references any of these entities
must use the
<I>M_stopwatch</I> module, i.e., must contain the statement
<P>
use M_stopwatch
<P>
The derived types are:
<P>
<TABLE cellpadding=3>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>
o
</TD><TD>
<I>watchtype</I> -- used for declaring a variable to be a watch
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>
o
</TD><TD>
<I>watchgroup</I> -- used for declaring a variable to be a handle for a
group of watches
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
<P>
These two types have public accessibility, but the
internals of the type are private.  Any operations
performed on a variable of one of these types must be
performed by one of the M_StopWatch subroutines.
<P>
This man page describes, in general terms, the
operations that can be performed by the M_StopWatch
subroutines.  The formal interfaces and detailed
descriptions of the routines can be found in the
individual man pages.
<P>
A watch is a variable declared to be of type
<I>watchtype.</I> It can be passed to subroutines as an actual argument
or through modules like any Fortran variable, but can
only be operated on by the M_StopWatch subroutines.
Watches must be created by subroutine
<B>create_watch</B> before they are used.  Attempting to use a watch that
has not been created will generate a Fortran 90 error,
from attempting to pass a pointer with undefined
association status to the Fortran intrinsic function
<B>associated.</B> Watches must be destroyed when no longer useful.  For
example, consider a local variable of type
<I>watchtype</I> in a subroutine.  Since the contents of a local
variable are lost when the subroutine returns, the
watch should be destroyed before returning to the
calling program.  Failure to destroy watches can lead
to a memory leak.
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>
o
</TD><TD>
<B>create_watch</B> -- creates a watch
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>
o
</TD><TD>
<B>destroy_watch</B> -- destroys a watch
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
<P>
Watches can optionally be given a name (up to 132
characters) through an optional argument,
<I>name,</I> in
<B>create_watch.</B> This name is used in error messages and
<B>print_watch</B> to identify the watch in the printed output.
<P>
Different applications demand different definitions of
&#145;&#145;time&#146;&#146;.  M_StopWatch supports four clocks in each
watch, with each clock measuring a different concept of
time.  All of them measure time in seconds.
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>
o

program

</TD></TR>

support of the user&#146;s program
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>

<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>

wall -- the wall clock time, i.e., elapsed real time
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
<P>
It is not required that all clocks be used.  A watch
can be created with any combination of the four clocks.
You can also specify a set of
<I>default clocks</I> to be used whenever the clocks are not explicitly
determined.
<P>
Since Fortran 90 does not contain an intrinsic function
for CPU time, the implementation of the cpu, sys and
user clocks is system dependent.  Some implementations
may support only cpu and wall, not user and sys.  Some
implementations may support only wall.  Since the
Fortran 90 standard requires the existence of a
<B>system_clock</B> subroutine, but does not require that it provide clock
information, it is possible that some implementations
might not support wall.  Clock availability can be
determined by
<B>inquiry_stopwatch.</B> Unavailable clocks will automatically be removed from
the set of default clocks, but if a clock that is not
available is explicitly requested, a warning message
will be generated.
<P>
M_StopWatch supports multiple watches simultaneously.
Often it is useful to perform the same operation on
several watches.  This is essential for correct
operation of
<B>pause_watch</B> and
<B>end_pause_watch,</B> and can also be convenient for procedures like
<B>read_watch, print_watch,</B> and
<B>reset_watch.</B> To facilitate this, M_StopWatch supports the concept of
<I>watch groups.</I> When calling a M_StopWatch subroutine, a watch group can
be specified instead of a watch.  The group is
referenced by a variable of type
<I>watchgroup.</I> Watch groups must be created before they are used.
Attempting to use a watch group that has not been
created will generate a Fortran 90 error, from
attempting to pass a pointer with undefined association
status to the Fortran intrinsic function
<B>associated.</B> Watch groups must be destroyed when no longer useful.
The watches themselves are not destroyed, only the
grouping of them.  Failure to destroy watch groups can
lead to a memory leak.

Most M_StopWatch subroutines take
<I>watch</I> as the first dummy argument, and accept several forms
of
<I>watch.</I> The forms are:
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>
o
</TD><TD>
type (watchtype) watch -- a single watch
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>
o
</TD><TD>
type (watchtype) watch(:)  -- an array of watches
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>
o
</TD><TD>
type (watchgroup) watch -- a watch group handle
<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
<P>
In most M_StopWatch routines, an array of watches can be
specified by an array constructor in the calling
statement, for example:
<P>
type (watchtype) watch ::  w1, w2, w3
<P>
call print_watch( (/w1,w2,w3/) )
<P>
However, this can not be used in routines where
<I>watch</I> has intent OUT or intent INOUT, because the array
constructor is actually an expression, not a list of
the variables.  Currently this includes the routines
<B>create_watch</B> and
<B>destroy_watch.</B> <P>
Most M_StopWatch subroutines take
<I>clock</I> as the (optional) second dummy argument to determine
which of the four clocks will be affected by the
action.
<I>clock</I> can be one of the character strings &#146;user&#146;, &#146;sys&#146;,
&#39;cpu&#146;, or &#146;wall&#146;, or can be an array of such character
strings to specify more than one clock.  Since
<I>clock</I> is always intent IN, an array of clock types can be
built with an array constructor.  However, note that
Fortran 90 requires all character strings in such a
construction to have the same length.  Thus &#146;sys&#146; and
&#39;cpu&#146; should be padded with a blank, as in:
<P>
call start_watch(watch, (/&#146;user&#146;,&#146;sys &#146;,&#146;cpu &#146;/) )
<P>
If the optional argument
<I>clock</I> is omitted, the current set of default clocks is used.
The set of default clocks is set with
<B>option_stopwatch</B> and initially consists of all available clocks.
<P>
A M_StopWatch watch is operated on by subroutine calls
that correspond to the actions performed with a common
stop watch.  The basic operation of a watch involves
starting it, stopping it, and resetting it to 0.

<TR><TD colspan=2>
<P>
The routine
<B>read_watch</B> is a function subroutine.  The result is either a
scalar, array of rank one, or array of rank two
depending on whether
<I>watch</I> and
<I>clock</I> are scalars or arrays.
<P>
When measuring CPU time, it is often desirable to not
include the time used by certain parts of the code,
such as printing or graphics.  In a subroutine, you
might not know which of the clocks are currently
running, so you can not simply stop them before the I/O
and start them up again after the I/O. For this,
M_StopWatch provides the pause function.

     <H3>DIAGNOSTICS</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All M_StopWatch subroutines take an optional intent OUT
integer argument
<I>err</I> which, if present, returns a status code.  The code is
the sum of the values listed below.
<P>
Errors can also be determined through printed error
messages.  An error message will be printed to a
specified I/O unit (unit 6 by default) if
<I>print_errors</I> is TRUE (default is TRUE). The error message contains
more detail about the cause of the error than can be
obtained from just the status code, so you should set
<I>print_errors</I> to TRUE if you have trouble determining the cause of
the error.
<P>
All errors are non-fatal.  If
<I>abort_errors</I> is TRUE (default is FALSE), the program will terminate
on an error condition.  Otherwise, the program will
continue execution but the requested operation will not
be performed.
<P>
See
<B>option_stopwatch</B>(3)
for further information on
<I>print_errors, abort_errors</I> and I/O units.

In Fortran 90, the character strings in an array
constructor must all have the same length.  Pad three

watch names so they all have the same length (within an

       and the Total wall clock is due to not pausing the wall clock
       on the Total watch while printing.

If you simply need to time a certain portion of the code and do not wish to use the
module the SYSTEM_CLOCK(3f) intrinsic may be sufficient:
<P>
<PRE>
   :
   :
call system_clock(count_rate=clock_rate) !Find the time rate
call system_clock(count=clock_start)     !Start Timer
<P>
call do_something_subroutine             !This is what gets timed
<P>
call system_clock(count=clock_stop)      ! Stop Timer
e_time = real(clock_stop-clock_start)/real(clock_rate)
   :
   :
</PRE>
<P>
For full timing analysis during the development cycle
programming environments generally provide a profiler tool.
<P>
If you use the GNU compiler, check out gprof.
In short, you&#146;ll add the -pg flag to your compiler, like so:
<PRE>
gfortran -g -pg -0 myprogram myprogram.F
</PRE>
Then, run the program and a file called "gmon.out" will be
generated. Then, for example,  call
<PRE>
gprof --line myprogram gmon.out
</PRE>
This will give a line-by-line CPU time profile.
<P>
<P>
MPI_WTIME: This is a high resolution wall-clock that will work anywhere
MPI is available. The downside is that if your program doesn&#146;t already
use MPI, you&#146;ll have to wrap MPI around it (which isn&#146;t hard). Here is
a simple example:
<PRE>
  include &#146;mpif.h&#146;
  DOUBLE PRECISION :: start, end
  start = MPI_Wtime()
<P>
  ! code to be timed
<P>
  end   = MPI_Wtime()
  write(*,*) &#146;That took &#146;,end-start,&#146; seconds&#146;
</PRE>

     <H3>BUGS</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It cannot be determined whether or not a watch variable
or watch group has been created (passed as an argument
to
<B>create_watch</B> or
<B>create_watchgroup</B>). If a watch or watch group that has never been created
is passed into a M_StopWatch subroutine, it might
generate a Fortran error due to passing a pointer with
undefined association status to the Fortran intrinsic
function
<B>associated.</B> However, some compilers will allow this as an extension
to the Fortran 90 standard and recognize that the
pointer is not associated, in which case the &#145;&#145;Watch
needs to be created&#146;&#146; error message is generated.
