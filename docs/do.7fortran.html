  8.1.7     DO construct
  8.1.7.1    Purpose and form of the DO construct
<P>
1 The DO construct specifies the repeated execution of a sequence of
  executable constructs. Such a repeated sequence is called a loop.
<P>
2 The number of iterations of a loop may be determined at the beginning
  of execution of the DO construct, or
  may be left indefinite ("DO forever" or DO WHILE). Except in the case
  of a DO CONCURRENT construct, the loop can be terminated immediately
  (8.1.7.6.4). The current iteration of the loop may be curtailed by
  executing a CYCLE statement (8.1.7.6.3).
<P>
3 There are three phases in the execution of a DO construct: initiation
  of the loop, execution of the loop range,
  and termination of the loop.
<P>
4 The DO CONCURRENT construct is a DO construct whose DO statement
  contains the CONCURRENT keyword.
<P>
5 The DO construct may be written in either a block form or a nonblock form.
<P>
  R821      do-construct                     is block-do-construct

  C817      (R822) If the do-stmt of a block-do-construct specifies a

            shall be an end-do-stmt specifying the same
            do-construct-name. If the do-stmt of a block-do-construct
            does not specify a do-construct-name, the corresponding
            end-do shall not specify a do-construct-name.
<P>

<P>
1 The do-term-action-stmt, do-term-shared-stmt, or
  shared-term-do-construct following the do-body of a nonblock DO
  construct is called the DO termination of that construct.
<P>
2 Within a scoping unit, all DO constructs whose DO statements refer to
  the same label are nonblock DO constructs, and share the
  statement identified by that label.
<P>
    8.1.7.4      Range of the DO construct
<P>
1 The range of a block DO construct is the do-block , which shall satisfy
  the rules for blocks (8.1.2). In particular,
  transfer of control to the interior of such a block from outside the
  block is prohibited. It is permitted to branch to the end-do of a
  block DO construct only from within the range of that DO construct.
<P>
2 The range of a nonblock DO construct consists of the do-body and the
  following DO termination. The end of such a range is not
  bounded by a particular statement as for the other executable
  constructs (e.g., END IF); nevertheless, the range satisfies the rules
  for blocks (8.1.2). Transfer of control into the do-body or to the
  DO termination from outside the range is prohibited; in particular,
  it is permitted to branch to a do-term-shared-stmt only from within
  the range of the corresponding inner-shared-do-construct.
<P>
    8.1.7.5      Active and inactive DO constructs
<P>
1 A DO construct is either active or inactive. Initially inactive,
  a DO construct becomes active only when its
  DO statement is executed.
<P>
2 Once active, the DO construct becomes inactive only when it terminates
  (8.1.7.6.4).
<P>
    8.1.7.6      Execution of a DO construct
<P>
    8.1.7.6.1     Loop initiation
<P>
1 When the DO statement is executed, the DO construct becomes active. If loop-control is
<P>
2       [ , ] do-variable = scalar-int-expr 1 , scalar-int-expr 2 [ , scalar-int-expr 3 ]
<P>
3 the following steps are performed in sequence.
          1.    The initial parameter m1 , the terminal parameter m2 ,
                and the incrementation parameter m3 are
                of type integer with the same kind type parameter
                as the do-variable. Their values are established by
                evaluating scalar-int-expr 1 , scalar-int-expr 2 , and
                scalar-int-expr 3 , respectively, including, if necessary,
                conversion to the kind type parameter of the
                do-variable according to the rules for numeric conversion
                (Table 7.11). If scalar-int-expr 3 does not appear,
                m3 has the value 1. The value of m3
                shall not be zero.
          2.    The DO variable becomes defined with the value of the initial parameter m1 .
          3.    The iteration count is established and is the value of
                the expression (m2 - m1 + m3 )/m3 , unless that value is negative,
                in which case the iteration count is 0.
<P>
        NOTE 8.11
        The iteration count is zero whenever:
<P>
              m1 &gt; m2 and m3 &gt; 0, or
              m1 &lt; m2 and m3 &lt; 0.
<P>
4 If loop-control is omitted, no iteration count is calculated. The
  effect is as if a large positive iteration count,
  impossible to decrement to zero, were established. If loop-control is
  [ , ] WHILE (scalar-logical-expr ), the effect is as if loop-control
  were omitted and the following statement inserted as the first statement
  of the do-block :
<P>
5 IF (.NOT. (scalar-logical-expr )) EXIT
<P>
6 For a DO CONCURRENT construct, the values of the index variables for
  the iterations of the construct are
  determined by the rules for the index variables of the FORALL construct
  (7.2.4.2.2 and 7.2.4.2.3).
<P>
7 An index-name in a DO CONCURRENT construct has a scope of the construct
  (16.4). It is a scalar variable
  that has the type and type parameters that it would have if it were
  the name of a variable in the scoping unit that includes the construct,
  and this type shall be integer type; it has no other attributes.
<P>
8 At the completion of the execution of the DO statement, the execution
  cycle begins.
<P>
  8.1.7.6.2     The execution cycle
<P>
1 The execution cycle of a DO construct that is not a DO CONCURRENT
  construct consists of the following steps performed in sequence
  repeatedly until termination.
<P>
          1.    The iteration count, if any, is tested. If it is zero,
                the loop terminates and the DO construct becomes
                inactive. If loop-control is [ , ] WHILE
                (scalar-logical-expr ), the scalar-logical-expr is
                evaluated; if the value of this expression is false, the
                loop terminates and the DO construct becomes inactive. If,
                as a result, all of the DO constructs sharing the
                do-term-shared-stmt are inactive, the execution of all
                of these constructs is complete. However, if some of the
                DO constructs sharing the do-term-shared-stmt are active,
                execution continues with step (3) of the execution cycle
                of the active DO construct whose DO statement was most
                recently executed.
          2.    The range of the loop is executed.
          3.    The iteration count, if any, is decremented by one. The
                DO variable, if any, is incremented by the
                value of the incrementation parameter m3 .
<P>
  Except for the incrementation of the DO variable that occurs in step
  (3), the DO variable shall neither be redefined
  nor become undefined while the DO construct is active.
<P>
  The range of a DO CONCURRENT construct is executed for all of the
  active combinations of the index-name
  values. Each execution of the range is an iteration. The executions
  may occur in any order.
<P>
  8.1.7.6.3     CYCLE statement
<P>
  Execution of the range of the loop may be curtailed by executing a
  CYCLE statement from within the range of the loop.
<P>
  R839     cycle-stmt                         is   CYCLE [ do-construct-name ]
<P>
  C824     (R839) If a do-construct-name appears, the CYCLE statement
           shall be within the range of that do-construct;
           otherwise, it shall be within the range of at
           least one do-construct.
<P>
  C825     (R839) A cycle-stmt shall not appear within the range of a
           DO CONCURRENT construct if it belongs to an outer construct.
<P>
2 A CYCLE statement belongs to a particular DO construct. If the CYCLE
  statement contains a DO construct name, it belongs to that DO construct;
  otherwise, it belongs to the innermost DO construct in which it appears.
<P>
3 Execution of a CYCLE statement that belongs to a DO construct that is
  not a DO CONCURRENT construct
  causes immediate progression to step (3) of the current execution
  cycle of the DO construct to which it belongs. If this construct is a
  nonblock DO construct, the do-term-action-stmt or do-term-shared-stmt
  is not executed.
<P>
4 Execution of a CYCLE statement that belongs to a DO CONCURRENT construct
  completes execution of that iteration of the construct.
<P>
5 In a block DO construct, a transfer of control to the end-do has the
  same effect as execution of a CYCLE statement
  belonging to that construct. In a nonblock DO construct, transfer
  of control to the do-term-action-stmt or do-term-shared-stmt causes
  that statement to be executed. Unless a further transfer of control
  results, step (3) of the current execution cycle of the DO construct
  is then executed.
<P>
  8.1.7.6.4    Loop termination
<P>
1 For a DO construct that is not a DO CONCURRENT construct, the loop
  terminates, and the DO construct becomes inactive, when any of the
  following occurs.
<P>
        The iteration count is determined to be zero or the
      scalar-logical-expr is false, when tested during step (1)
        of the above execution cycle.
<P>
        An EXIT statement that belongs to the DO construct is executed.
<P>
        An EXIT or CYCLE statement that belongs to an outer construct
      and is within the range of the DO
        construct is executed.
<P>
        Control is transferred from a statement within the range of a
        DO construct to a statement that is neither
        the end-do nor within the range of the same DO construct.
<P>
        A RETURN statement within the range of the DO construct is executed.
<P>
2 For a DO CONCURRENT construct, the loop terminates, and the DO construct
  becomes inactive when all of the iterations have completed execution.
<P>
3 When a DO construct becomes inactive, the DO variable, if any, of the
  DO construct retains its last defined value.
<P>
  8.1.7.7     Restrictions on DO CONCURRENT constructs
<P>
  C826      A RETURN statement shall not appear within a DO CONCURRENT construct.
<P>
  C827      A branch (8.2) within a DO CONCURRENT construct shall not have a branch target that is outside
            the construct.
<P>
  C828      A reference to a nonpure procedure shall not appear within a DO CONCURRENT construct.
<P>
  C829      A reference to the procedure IEEE GET FLAG, IEEE SET HALTING MODE, or IEEE GET HALT
            ING MODE from the intrinsic module IEEE EXCEPTIONS, shall not appear within a DO CONCURRENT construct.
<P>
1 The following additional restrictions apply to DO CONCURRENT constructs.
<P>
      A variable that is referenced in an iteration shall either be
      previously defined during that iteration, or shall not be defined
      or become undefined during any other iteration of the current
      execution of the construct. A variable that is defined or becomes
      undefined by more than one iteration of the current execution of
      the construct becomes undefined when the current execution of
      the construct terminates. A pointer that is referenced in an
      iteration either shall be previously pointer associated during
      that iteration, or shall not have its pointer association changed
      during any iteration. A pointer that has its pointer association
      changed in more than one iteration has an association status of
      undefined when the construct terminates.
<P>
     An allocatable object that is allocated in more than one iteration
     shall be subsequently deallocated during the same iteration in which
     it was allocated. An object that is allocated or deallocated in
     only one iteration shall not be deallocated, allocated, referenced,
     defined, or become undefined in a different iteration.
     An input/output statement shall not write data to a file record or
     position in one iteration and read from the same record or position
     in a different iteration of the same execution of the construct.
     Records written by output statements in the loop range to a
     sequential access file appear in the file in an indeterminate order.
<P>
      NOTE 8.12
      The restrictions on referencing variables defined in an iteration
      of a DO CONCURRENT construct apply to any procedure invoked within
      the loop.
<P>
      NOTE 8.13
      The restrictions on the statements in the loop range of a DO
      CONCURRENT construct are designed to ensure there are no data
      dependencies between iterations of the loop. This permits code
      optimizations that might otherwise be difficult or impossible
      because they would depend on properties of the program not visible
      to the compiler.

8.1.7.8    Examples of DO constructs
<P>
      NOTE 8.14
      The following program fragment computes a tensor product of two arrays:
<P>
      DO I = 1, M
         DO J = 1, N
            C (I, J) = DOT_PRODUCT (A (I, J, :), B(:, I, J))
         END DO
      END DO
<P>
      NOTE 8.15
      The following program fragment contains a DO construct that uses the
      WHILE form of loop-control . The loop will continue to execute until
      an end-of-file or input/output error is encountered, at which point
      the DO statement terminates the loop. When a negative value of X
      is read, the program skips immediately to the next READ statement,
      bypassing most of the range of the loop.
<P>
      READ (IUN, &#146;(1X, G14.7)&#146;, IOSTAT = IOS) X
      DO WHILE (IOS == 0)
         IF (X &gt;= 0.) THEN
            CALL SUBA (X)
            CALL SUBB (X)
                 ...
            CALL SUBZ (X)
         ENDIF
         READ (IUN, &#146;(1X, G14.7)&#146;, IOSTAT = IOS) X
      END DO
<P>
      NOTE 8.16
      The following example behaves exactly the same as the one in Note
      8.15. However, the READ statement has been moved to the interior
      of the range, so that only one READ statement is needed. Also, a
      CYCLE statement has been used to avoid an extra level of IF nesting.

          READ (IUN, &#146;(1X, G14.7)&#146;, IOSTAT = IOS) X
          IF (IOS /= 0) EXIT
          IF (X &lt; 0.) CYCLE

       NOTE 8.17
       The following example represents a case in which the user knows
       that there are no repeated values in the index array IND. The DO
       CONCURRENT construct makes it easier for the processor to generate
       vector gather/scatter code, unroll the loop, or parallelize the
       code for this loop, potentially improving performance.
<P>
       INTEGER :: A(N),IND(N)
<P>
       DO CONCURRENT (I=1:M)
          A(IND(I)) = I
       END DO
<P>
       NOTE 8.18
       Additional examples of DO constructs are in C.5.3.
