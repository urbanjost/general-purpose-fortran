NAME
   complex(7f) - [FORTRAN] complex variables
SYNOPSIS
   complex(kind=NN) :: name
   complex(kind=NN) :: name=(r,i)
DESCRIPTION
   In mathematics, a complex number has a real and an imaginary
   component. In Fortran, complex numbers are stored as a pair of REAL
   numbers (the first representing the real part, the following the
   imaginary part). Using the correct KIND allows for DOUBLEPRECISION
   COMPLEX values.

   Any expression involving COMPLEX numbers and other numbers is promoted
   to COMPLEX.

   All of the arithmetic operators can take a COMPLEX number on either
   side (left hand side or right hand side) of an expression such
   as LHS=RHS.

   DECLARATION
   The standard way to declare a complex variable is simply to use the COMPLEX
   statement:

      COMPLEX myVariable, anotherVariable, anArray(2,3)

   Examples of complex declarations are

      COMPLEX (KIND = KIND(0.0D0)) :: C
      COMPLEX :: CUBE_ROOT = (-0.5, 0.866)

   CONSTANTS AND EXPRESSIONS
   Complex constants are specified as "(",a real value, a comma, another real
   value and ")". Some examples are 1 as (1.0,0.0), i as (0.0,1.0), 2-3i as
   (2.0,-3.0), and 1000000000i as (0.0,1.0E+09). The same constants can
   be coded as double-precision complex constants by the simple expedient
   of using a D in the exponent. Thus, the same constants can be coded
   in double-precision using (1.0D+00,0.0D+00), (0.0D+00,1.0D+00),
   (2.0D+00,-3.0D+00), and (0.0D+00,1.0D+09), respectively. Note: This
   notation cannot be used with variables. For example, (a, b) is invalid.

   Examples of complex constants are

      (1.0, -1.0)
      (3, 3.1E6)
      (4.0_4, 3.6E7_8)
      ( 0.0, PI)  ! where PI is a previously declared named
                  ! scalar numeric CONSTANT, not a variable.


   CMPLX AND DOUBLE PRECISION

   To convert real variables to complex, use the CMPLX function.

   The Fortran 90 language defines CMPLX() as always returning a result
   that is type COMPLEX(KIND=KIND(0.0)).

   This means `CMPLX(D1,D2)', where `D1' and `D2' are DOUBLEPRECISION,
   is treated as:

      CMPLX(SNGL(D1), SNGL(D2))

   If you want double-precision complex numbers, you're pretty much
   stuck with specifying a precision.

   It was necessary for Fortran 90 to specify this behavior for
   DOUBLEPRECISION arguments, since that is the behavior mandated by
   FORTRAN 77.

   So Fortran 90 extends the CMPLX() intrinsic by adding an extra argument
   used to specify the desired kind of complex result.

      integer,parameter :: dp=kind(0.0d0)
      complex(kind=dp) :: z8
      !
      ! NO: result is just real because KIND parameter is not specified
      !
      z8 = cmplx(1.2345678901234567d0, 1.2345678901234567d0)       ! note this was stored with default real precision
      print *, 'NO, Z8=',z8,real(z8),aimag(z8)                     ! notice components are just truncated to real
      z8 = cmplx(1.2345678901234567e0_dp, 1.2345678901234567e0_dp) ! note works with e0, not d0
      print *, 'NO, Z8=',z8,real(z8),aimag(z8)                     ! note components are just real
      !
      ! YES
      !
      z8 = cmplx(1.2345678901234567d0, 1.2345678901234567d0,kind=dp) ! kind= makes it work
      print *, 'YES, Z8=',z8,real(z8),aimag(z8)

   F2018 COMPONENT SYNTAX
   The real and imaginary parts of a complex entity can be accessed
   independently with a component-like syntax in f2018:

   A complex-part-designator is

      designator % RE
      or
      designator % IM.

   The designator shall be of complex type.

   So designator%RE designates the real part of a complex value,
   designator%IM designates the imaginary part of complex value. The
   type of a complex-part-designator is real, and its kind and shape
   are those of the designator.

   The following are examples of complex part designators:

       impedance%re           !-- Same value as REAL(impedance)
       fft%im                 !-- Same value as AIMAG(fft)
       x%im = 0.0             !-- Sets the imaginary part of X to zero

      program components
      integer,parameter :: dp=kind(0.0d0)
      complex(kind=dp) ::  z8
       z8 = cmplx(1.2345678901234567d0, 1.2345678901234567d0,kind=dp)
       print *, 'Z8=',z8,z8%re,z8%im
       print *, real(aimag(z8),kind=dp)
       print *, real(z8)
      end program components

   C
   Your C-compiler can work with complex numbers if it supports the C99
   standard. Link with -lm. The imaginary unit is represented by I.

        /* check that exp(i * pi) == -1 */
        #include <math.h>       /* for atan */
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <complex.h>

        int
        main(void)
        {
           double pi = 4 * atan(1.0);
           double complex z = cexp(I * pi);
           printf("%f + %f * i\n", creal(z), cimag(z));
        }
EXAMPLE
  Sample program:

   program demo_aimag
   integer,parameter :: dp=kind(0.0d0)
   complex          :: z4
   complex(kind=dp) :: z8
   real(kind=dp)    :: d8
      z4 = cmplx(1.2345678901234567d0, 1.2345678901234567d0) ! no kind so values on LHS are converted to default real
      z8 = cmplx(1.2345678901234567d0, 1.2345678901234567d0,kind=dp) ! kind= makes it work
   end program demo_aimag

WORKING ON
  Sample using aimag

   program demo_aimag
   integer,parameter :: dp=kind(0.0d0)
   complex          :: z4
   complex(kind=dp) :: z8
   real(kind=dp)    :: d8
   d8 = 1.2345678901234567     ! NO: might be truncated to default real
   print *, 'NO, D8=',d8
   d8 = 1.2345678901234567_dp  ! should work; note that only one value was specified
   print *, 'D8=',d8
   d8 = 1.2345678901234567d0   ! should work
   print *, 'D8=',d8
   ! intuitive and works without calling cmplx(3f) but does not work for variables
   z8 = (1.2345678901234567d0 , 1.2345678901234567d0 )
   print *, 'Z8=',z8
