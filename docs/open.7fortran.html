     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
An OPEN statement initiates or modifies the connection between an
external file and a specified unit. The OPEN statement may be used to
connect an existing file to a unit, create a file that is preconnected,
create a file and connect it to a unit, or change certain modes of a
connection between a file and a unit.
<P>
An external unit may be connected by an OPEN statement in the main
program or any subprogram and, once connected, a reference to it may
appear in any program unit of the program.
<P>
If the file to be connected to the unit does not exist but is the same
as the file to which the unit is preconnected, the modes specified by an
OPEN statement become a part of the connection.
<P>
If the file to be connected to the unit is not the same as the file to
which the unit is connected, the effect is as if a CLOSE statement
without a STATUS= specifier had been executed for the unit immediately
prior to the execution of an OPEN statement.
<P>
If a unit is connected to a file that exists, execution of an OPEN
statement for that unit is permitted. If the FILE= specifier is not
included in such an OPEN statement, the file to be connected to the unit
is the same as the file to which the unit is already connected.
<P>
If the file to be connected to the unit is the same as the file to which
the unit is connected, only the specifiers for changeable modes (9.5.2)
may have values different from those currently in effect. If the
POSITION= specifier appears in such an OPEN statement, the value
specified shall not disagree with the current position of the file. If
the STATUS= specifier is included in such an OPEN statement, it shall be
specified with the value OLD. Execution of such an OPEN statement causes
any new values of the specifiers for changeable modes to be in effect,
but does not cause any change in any of the unspecified specifiers and
the position of the file is unaffected. The ERR=, IOSTAT=, and IOMSG=
specifiers from any previously executed OPEN statement have no effect on
any currently executed OPEN statement.
<P>
A STATUS= specifier with a value of OLD is always allowed when the file
to be connected to the unit is the same as the file to which the unit is
connected. In this case, if the status of the file was SCRATCH before
execution of the OPEN statement, the file will still be deleted when the
unit is closed, and the file is still considered to have a status of
SCRATCH.
<P>
If a file is already connected to a unit, an OPEN statement on that file
with a different unit shall not be executed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
A specifier that requires a scalar-default-char-expr may have a limited
list of character values. These values are listed for each such
specifier. Any trailing blanks are ignored. The value specified is
without regard to case. Some specifiers have a default value if the
specifier is omitted. No specifier shall appear more than once in a
given connect-spec-list.
<P>
If the NEWUNIT= specifier does not appear, a file-unit-number shall be
specified; if the optional characters UNIT= are omitted, the
file-unit-number shall be the first item in the connect-spec-list.
<P>
The label used in the ERR= specifier shall be the statement label of a
branch target statement that appears in the same scoping unit as the
OPEN statement.
<P>
If a NEWUNIT= specifier appears, a file-unit-number shall not appear.
<P>
IOSTAT=, ERR=, and IOMSG= specifiers are described in 9.11.

     <H3>KEYWORDS</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
ACCESS : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to SEQUENTIAL,
DIRECT, or STREAM. The ACCESS= specifier specifies the access method for
the connection of the file as being sequential, direct, or stream. If
this specifier is omitted, the default value is SEQUENTIAL. For an
existing file, the specified access method shall be included in the set
of allowed access methods for the file. For a new file, the processor
creates the file with a set of allowed access methods that includes the
specified method.
<P>
ACTION : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to READ, WRITE, or
READWRITE. READ specifies that the WRITE, PRINT, and ENDFILE statements
shall not refer to this connection. WRITE specifies that READ statements
shall not refer to this connection. READWRITE permits any input/output
statements to refer to this connection. If this specifier is omitted,
the default value is processor dependent. If READWRITE is included in
the set of allowable actions for a file, both READ and WRITE also shall
be included in the set of allowed actions for that file. For an existing
file, the specified action shall be included in the set of allowed
actions for the file. For a new file, the processor creates the file
with a set of allowed actions that includes the specified action.
<P>
ASYNCHRONOUS : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to YES or NO.
If YES is specified, asynchronous input/output on the unit is allowed.
If NO is specified, asynchronous input/output on the unit is not
allowed. If this specifier is omitted, the default value is NO.
<P>
BLANK : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to NULL or ZERO. The
BLANK= specifier is permitted only for a connection for formatted
input/output. It specifies the current value of the blank interpretation
mode (10.8.6, 9.6.2.6) for input for this connection. This mode has no
effect on output. It is a changeable mode (9.5.2). If this specifier is
omitted in an OPEN statement that initiates a connection, the default
value is NULL.
<P>
DECIMAL : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to COMMA or POINT.
The DECIMAL= specifier is permitted only for a connection for formatted
input/output. It specifies the current value of the decimal edit mode
(10.6, 10.8.8, 9.6.2.7) for this connection. This is a changeable mode
(9.5.2). If this specifier is omitted in an OPEN statement that
initiates a connection, the default value is POINT.
<P>
DELIM : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to APOSTROPHE,
QUOTE, or NONE. The DELIM= specifier is permitted only for a connection
for formatted input/output. It specifies the current value of the
delimiter mode (9.6.2.8) for list-directed (10.10.4) and namelist
(10.11.4.2) output for the connection. This mode has no effect on input.
It is a changeable mode (9.5.2). If this specifier is omitted in an OPEN
statement that initiates a connection, the default value is NONE.
<P>
ENCODING : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to UTF-8 or
DEFAULT. The ENCODING= specifier is permitted only for a connection for
formatted input/output. The value UTF-8 specifies that the encoding form
of the file is UTF-8 as specified by ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000. Such a file
is called a Unicode file, and all characters therein are of ISO 10646
character type. The value UTF-8 shall not be specified if the processor
does not support the ISO 10646 character type. The value DEFAULT
specifies that the encoding form of the file is processor-dependent. If
this specifier is omitted in an OPEN statement that initiates a
connection, the default value is DEFAULT.
<P>
FILE : The value of the FILE= specifier is the name of the file to be
connected to the specified unit. Any trailing blanks are ignored. The
file-name-expr shall be a name that is allowed by the processor. If this
specifier is omitted and the unit is not connected to a file, the
STATUS= specifier shall be specified with a value of SCRATCH; in this
case, the connection is made to a processor-dependent file. The
interpretation of case is processor dependent.
<P>
FORM : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to FORMATTED or
UNFORMATTED. The FORM= specifier determines whether the file is being
connected for formatted or unformatted input/output. If this specifier
is omitted, the default value is UNFORMATTED if the file is being
connected for direct access or stream access, and the default value is
FORMATTED if the file is being connected for sequential access. For an
existing file, the specified form shall be included in the set of
allowed forms for the file. For a new file, the processor creates the
file with a set of allowed forms that includes the specified form.
<P>
NEWUNIT : If the NEWUNIT= specifier appears in an OPEN statement, either
the FILE= specifier shall appear, or the STATUS= specifier shall appear
with a value of SCRATCH. The unit identified by a NEWUNIT value shall
not be preconnected.
<P>
The variable is defined with a processor determined NEWUNIT value if no
error occurs during the execution of the OPEN statement. If an error
occurs, the processor shall not change the value of the variable.
<P>
A NEWUNIT value is a negative number, and shall not be equal to <B>-1</B>, any
of the named constants ERROR_UNIT, INPUT_UNIT, or OUTPUT_UNIT from the
intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2), any value used by the
processor for the unit argument to a defined input/output procedure, nor
any previous NEWUNIT value that identifies a file that is currently
connected.
<P>
PAD : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to YES or NO. The PAD=
specifier is permitted only for a connection for formatted input/output.
It specifies the current value of the pad mode (9.6.4.4.3, 9.6.2.10) for
input for this connection. This mode has no effect on output. It is a
changeable mode (9.5.2). If this specifier is omitted in an OPEN
statement that initiates a connection, the default value is YES.
<P>
POSITION : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to ASIS, REWIND,
or APPEND. The connection shall be for sequential or stream access. A
new file is positioned at its initial point. REWIND positions an
existing file at its initial point. APPEND positions an existing file
such that the endfile record is the next record, if it has one. If an
existing file does not have an endfile record, APPEND positions the file
at its terminal point. ASIS leaves the position unchanged if the file
exists and already is connected. ASIS leaves the position unspecified if
the file exists but is not connected. If this specifier is omitted, the
default value is ASIS.
<P>
RECL : The value of the RECL= specifier shall be positive. It specifies
the length of each record in a file being connected for direct access,
or specifies the maximum length of a record in a file being connected
for sequential access. This specifier shall not appear when a file is
being connected for stream access. This specifier shall appear when a
file is being connected for direct access. If this specifier is omitted
when a file is being connected for sequential access, the default value
is processor dependent. If the file is being connected for formatted
input/output, the length is the number of characters for all records
that contain only characters of default kind. When a record contains any
nondefault characters, the effect of the RECL= specifier is processor
dependent. If the file is being connected for unformatted input/output,
the length is measured in file storage units. For an existing file, the
value of the RECL= specifier shall be included in the set of allowed
record lengths for the file. For a new file, the processor creates the
file with a set of allowed record lengths that includes the specified
value.
<P>
ROUND : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to one of UP, DOWN,
ZERO, NEAREST, COMPATIBLE, or PROCESSOR DEFINED. The ROUND= specifier is
permitted only for a connection for formatted input/output. It specifies
the current value of the I/O rounding mode for this connection. This is
a changeable mode. If this specifier is omitted in an OPEN statement
that initiates a connection, the I/O rounding mode is processor
dependent; it shall be one of the above modes.
<P>
A processor is free to select any I/O rounding mode for the default
mode. The mode might correspond to UP, DOWN, ZERO, NEAREST, or
COMPATIBLE; or it might be a completely different I/O rounding mode.
<P>
SIGN : The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to one of PLUS,
SUPPRESS, or PROCESSOR DEFINED. The SIGN= specifier is permitted only
for a connection for formatted input/output. It specifies the current
value of the sign mode this connection. This is a changeable mode. If
this specifier is omitted in an OPEN statement that initiates a
connection, the default value is PROCESSOR DEFINED.
<P>
STATUS : If the STATUS= specifier has the value NEW or REPLACE, the
FILE= specifier shall appear. If the STATUS= specifier has the value
SCRATCH, the FILE= specifier shall not appear. If the STATUS= specifier
has the value OLD, the FILE= specifier shall appear unless the unit is
connected and the file connected to the unit exists.
<P>
The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to OLD, NEW, SCRATCH,
REPLACE, or UNKNOWN. If OLD is specified, the file shall exist. If NEW
is specified, the file shall not exist.
<P>
Successful execution of an OPEN statement with NEW specified creates the
file and changes the status to OLD. If REPLACE is specified and the file
does not already exist, the file is created and the status is changed to
OLD. If REPLACE is specified and the file does exist, the file is
deleted, a new file is created with the same name, and the status is
changed to OLD. If SCRATCH is specified, the file is created and
connected to the specified unit for use by the program but is deleted at
the execution of a CLOSE statement referring to the same unit or at the
normal termination of the program.
<P>
SCRATCH shall not be specified with a named file.
<P>
If UNKNOWN is specified, the status is processor dependent. If this
specifier is omitted, the default value is UNKNOWN.
