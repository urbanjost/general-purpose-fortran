     <H3>SYNOPSIS</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
M_framework(3f) is an aggregate of Fortran modules brought together to
provide unit testing for Fortran; and is particularly well suited for
use with the Fortran Package Manager (fpm).
<P>
The support modules are useful for creating terminal messages, comparing
expected values to results, writing logfiles and playback journals
independent of unit testing as well.
<P>
Typically unit testing can be integrated seamlessly into the fpm(1) subcommand
"test" making unit testing from github/gitlab CD/CI utilities as simple as
"fpm test" in many cases.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=2>

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; BASIC TIMING IS INCLUDED</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As well as the expected **pass/fail/skipped unit testing** report.
basic **timing information** can be produced by the unit testing module
M_framework__verify(3f).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=3>

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; HOOKS ARE PROVIDED TO EXTERNAL LOCAL APPLICATIONS</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
M_framework(3f) comes with a unique hook that allows calling your own
programs to integrate with local logging tools, report generators,
spreadsheets or other local infrastructure. The example program
"bookkeeper" is included that uses the hook to write example report
data files:
<P>
<PRE>
 + [CSV](https://urbanjost.github.io/M_framework/bookkeeper.csv),
 + [HTML](https://urbanjost.github.io/M_framework/bookkeeper.html)
 + [NAMELIST](https://urbanjost.github.io/M_framework/bookkeeper.nml)
<P>
</PRE>
The hook can call any local program with an interface similar to
"bookkeeper". This allows modifying the program for local needs such
as sending e-mail alerts and so on without having to change the tests.
<P>
<PRE>
  MESSAGES CAN BE COMPOSED ALMOST LIKE LIST-DIRECTED I/O
</PRE>
Messages can be composed of up to twenty scalar intrinsic variables,
allowing freedom in writing messages akin to that of list-directed I/O;
but simultaneously to a list of output units. This easily lets messages
go to stdout or stderr and a file of the user&#146;s choosing as well. Output
can even be sent to a scratch file, essentially creating a quiet mode.
<P>
<PRE>
   DESIGNED FOR INTEGRATION WITH FPM(1)
</PRE>
In conjunction with fpm(1) it is easy to run the tests with the <B>--runner</B>
option, allowing for integration with other utilities as well such as
the GNU debugger gdb(1), valgrind(1), and other tools.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; MOTIVATION</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Including **unit testing** is strongly encouraged for any software package,
but particularly when it is to be used in programming environments the
package was not developed in.
<P>
This is the typical case for public fpm(1) packages on github.
<P>
Additionally the proposed rules for registered fpm(1) package repositories
include requiring package candidates themselves only have external
dependencies that are also registered repository packages ( of course
wrappers of C libraries or other existing libraries cannot easily be
conformed to this).
<P>
As a result -- this project concentrates on tools for a procedural unit
testing framework based on nothing but standard Fortran that specifically
can be used as a remote fpm(1) dependency in fpm(1) packages that may
reside in public github repositories.
<P>
That is, it is designed to be integrated with the fpm(1) "test" subcommand
as an external dependency. It is intended to have little or no other
dependencies and ultimately become a registered fpm(1) package to aid in
the development of the fpm(1) repository.
<P>
That being said, it can be used standalone as well.

     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Unit testing allows you to automatically confirm changes are acceptable
so you can quickly and confidently make and release changes. But many of
the operations required for testing are useful generically. So this
project is broken down into small general-purpose modules and
one unit-testing-specific one.
<P>
M_framework(3f) is composed of the following individual modules:
<P>
<PRE>
 + **M\_framework__msg** is a small module that in particular
   can convert a list of variables of any of the common default types
   to a string.
<P>
   It performs low-level operations that are often used by other larger
   modules so it is its own module to prevent circular dependencies.
<P>
 + **M\_framework__journal__** allows for creating log and journal files
<P>
 + **M\_framework__approx** contains routines for rounding and comparing
   floating-point values.
<P>
 + **M\_framework__help** provides for creating a standard simple
   interactive help facility
<P>
 + **M\_framework__verify** is at the heart of the collection and
   handles virtually all the unit-test-specific operations.
<P>
</PRE>
The procedures can be used in a variety of ways. After using them for
a long time my typical usage has changed completely several times.
<P>
As part of private software there was little problem calling the
procedures directly from within the modules where they resided; and even
auto-detecting the routines (a naming convention of "test\_suite\_$NAME"
was used). The routines were pre-installed on virtually all platforms
so using them was no more a burden than say, calling an intrinsic.
<P>
Put autodetecting tools (at least the ones employed) are not generally
portable; and with public packages there is a strong incentive to
minimize the amount of infrastructure and external dependencies. It is
generally imperative to make package use as simple and generic as possible.
<P>
So the suggested scheme is to create a small test program for each
procedure or closely related procedures in the fpm test/ directory.
<P>
<PRE>
 + make a subroutine for each component to be tested
 + in each test procedure start it with a call to UNIT\_TEST\_START(3f)
 + end each test procedure it with a call to UNIT\_TEST\_END(3f)
 + make multiple calls to UNIT\_TEST(3f) in-between to generate
   test results
 + call each of those test routines from the main program
 + end the main program with a call to UNIT\_TEST\_STOP(3f)
<P>
</PRE>
Optionally, before starting set preferred non-default modes.
<P>
Use the &#146;fpm test&#146; command to run specific tests; all tests (the default);
a list of tests or test names using simple globbing.
<P>
As desired, command line options can be used to control various test
behaviors.
<P>
As an example, we can create a skeleton program to test a few
routines. Using
<P>
<PRE>
     fpm test_suite sqrt cos sin &gt; test/test_suite.f90
<P>
</PRE>
to create the skeleton program and then adding a few actual
calls to unit\_test\_test(3f) results in
<P>
<PRE>
  Sample program:
<P>
   program M_test_suite_M_intrinsics
   use,intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : &
   & stderr=&gt;ERROR_UNIT, stdin=&gt;INPUT_UNIT, stdout=&gt;OUTPUT_UNIT
   !
   use M_framework, only : unit_test_start,unit_test,unit_test_end, &
                    unit_test_mode, unit_test_level, unit_test_stop
   use M_framework, only : CHECK_PREFIX ! change column one of messages
   !
   !use M_mymodule ! load any modules you will be testing
   implicit none
   double precision,allocatable :: expected(:), answers(:), input(:)
   double precision,parameter :: PI=atan(1.0d0)*4
   !! setup
      !---------------------------------------------------
      !OPTIONAL:
      !  values used in prefix column for various messages
      !  the default is to set them all to the basename of
      !  the executable running tests, but they can be
      !  altered. For example:
      CHECK_PREFIX=prefix(                  &
       test_MSG    =  &#146;test_msg:   &#146;, &
       test        =  &#146;test:      &#146;,  &
       test_START  =  &#146;test_start: &#146;, &
       test_STOP   =  &#146;test_stop:  &#146;, &
       test_END    =  &#146;test_end:   &#146;  &
      )
      !---------------------------------------------------
      !OPTIONAL:
      ! the options available at run-time on the command
      ! line can have their defaults selected. See the
      ! man-page for the procedure for details.
      call unit_test_mode(
        ( keep_going=.true. ,
        flags=[character(len=0) ::],
        luns=[stdout],

        match
        )
      !---------------------------------------------------
   !! test each subroutine
      call test_sqrt()
      call test_cos()
      call test_sin()
   !! teardown
      call unit_test_stop()
   contains
   subroutine test_sqrt()
   integer :: i
      call unit_test_start(&#146;sqrt&#146;,msg=&#146;calculate the square root&#146;)
      input   =[1.0d0,4.0d0,9.0d0]
      expected=[1.0d0,2.0d0,3.0d0]
      answers=[(sqrt(input(i)),i=1,size(input))]
      call unit_test(&#146;sqrt&#146;, all(expected.eq.answers),&
         & &#146;check table of values&#146;)
      call unit_test(&#146;sqrt&#146;, sqrt(25.0d0).eq.5.0d0,&
         & &#146;got&#146;,sqrt(25.0d0),&#146;expected&#146;,5.0d0)
      call unit_test_end(&#146;sqrt&#146;,msg=&#146;&#146;)
   end subroutine test_sqrt
<P>
   subroutine test_sin()
      call unit_test_start(&#146;sin&#146;,msg=&#146;calculate the sine of a value&#146;)
      call unit_test_end(&#146;sin&#146;,msg=&#146;&#146;)
   end subroutine test_sin
<P>
   subroutine test_cos()
      call unit_test_start(&#146;cos&#146;,msg=&#146;calculate the cosine of a value&#146;)
      call unit_test_end(&#146;cos&#146;,msg=&#146;&#146;)
   end subroutine test_cos
<P>
   end program M_test_suite_M_intrinsics
<P>
</PRE>
The output now looks like this (note if no calls to unit\_test
routines are made between unit_test_start(3f) and unit_test_end(3f)
the procedure gets an "UNTESTED" entry to remind you to make
some tests ..).
<P>
<PRE>
   &gt; test:       sqrt   SUCCESS : check table of values
   &gt; test:       sqrt   SUCCESS : got 5.0000000000000000 expected 5.0000000000000000
   &gt; test_end:   sqrt   PASSED  : GOOD:        2 BAD:        0 DURATION:00000000012000:
   &gt; test_end:   cos    UNTESTED: GOOD:        0 BAD:        0 DURATION:00000000000000:
   &gt; test_end:   sin    UNTESTED: GOOD:        0 BAD:        0 DURATION:00000000000000:
   &gt; test_stop:  TALLY  PASSED  : GOOD:        2 BAD:        0 DURATION:00000000000000
   &gt; STOP 0
<P>
</PRE>
this is a model that works particularly well for basic numeric procedures.
<P>
Now it is just a matter of adding more calls to unit\_test(3f). This is
where procedures from the other modules become useful, as they provide
methods for comparing float values, for example. Since Fortran has
many powerful masking intrinsics usually just the unit\_test(3f) procedure
is required. In particular, be familiar with the ALL(3f), ANY(3f),
and PACK(3f) procedures.
<P>
There are options to call a system command and use the initial string as
options, to interactively pause after each check, and to change options
like which output file to write on, what error level to use, and other
things I will hopefully solidify and document here.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; RECOMMENDED BASIC USAGE</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
So for an fpm(1) user a recommended process is to create and/or enter the
test/ directory and use the "unit\_test" program. It will make a test
program called "unit\_test\_$NAME.f90" for each name given on the command
line.
<P>
There is a case made for closely related groups of procedures to share
a single test file that will be made a little bit later. For that, the
command "test\_suite" is used instead of "unit\_test".
<P>
For now lets assume we have or plan to have the procedures
"a","b", and "c" in our package, and that we want to create a test for
each ( and that unit\_test(1) has been installed in your path):
<P>
<PRE>
    cd $TOP_OF_FPM_PACKAGE
    cd test
    unit_test a b c
<P>
</PRE>
If you then run "fpm test" the skeleton should run indicating the
procedures are not tested. Change the routines to actually call the
"unit\_test" procedure and you have the beginnings of a unit test for
your procedures.
<P>
The "unit\_test(3f)" procedure in its simplest form takes a string that
is usually the procedure name and a logical expression, along with up
to twenty completely optional intrinsic scalar values which will be used
to create an optional message.
<P>
The example programs also contain a placeholder call to unit\_test\_mode(3f).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=>

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; PROCEDURAL AND COMMAND LINE MODE OPTIONS</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The dummy skeleton routines all start with a call to unix\_test\_mode(3f).
Its documentation describes a few default modes you can change with the
routine. Essentially the same options are available on the command line
of the test program(s) as well.
<P>
<PRE>
    # options may be specified in NAMELIST input format with no
    # extraneous spaces on the command line
    fpm test -- flags=100,200,300 keep_going=T
    # a little more Unix-like or MSWindows-like syntax is allowed, as
    # these are equivalent to the original command &#46;&#46;&#46;
    fpm test -- --flags=100,200,300 --keep_going
    fpm test -- /flags=100,200,300 /keep_going=T
<P>
</PRE>
M_framework(3f) uses a built-in command line parser instead of
packages like M\_CLI or M\_CLI2 to minimize the number of dependencies
required.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; SUGGEST ONE TEST PER PROGRAM</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There are advantages to each procedure being tested with a separate
program.
<P>
A large number of individual test programs works well with fpm(1).
fpm defaults to running all the tests, but can execute subgroups
easily because it can execute a list of tests and the names can
use simple globbing.
<P>
If you autogenerate a list of procedure names to test and call the
sample program "unit_test" with the names of the procedures it will
generate new names but skip existing files; allowing for a simple form
of auto-generation assuming you have a way of listing all the procedure
names to test.
<P>
individual procedure tests can be deleted or added or moved easily when
each is in its own file.
<P>
It is easier to test with debuggers and other tools like gdb and valgrind
on small units.
<P>
This is true with other tools that you can use with <B>--runner</B> as well.
See "fpm help runner" or "fpm manual gt;manual.txt" for more information.

<A name=>

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; TESTING MANY PROCEDURES IN A SINGLE FILE</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If it is preferred, one program can test multiple procedures. The
main disadvantage is that the complete test suite is always run unless
conditional coding is added. One of the uses of the unit\_test\_flags(:)
array is to allow integer values to be passed at execution time that
can be tested to provide such conditional testing. When many tests are
in one file the unit_test_start(3f) procedure includes a "matched" argument
which can detect if a simple globbing expression that can be given on the
command line matches the string composed of the test name and message.
This allows you to optionally select specific groups of tests from a set.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; CALLING AN EXTERNAL PROGRAM</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
A unique feature of the M\_framework(3f) test harness is a hook to call
a custom program. You can ignore it is there, but it is a very powerful
feature if you want to do bookkeeping on the test results or enter
the results into a tracking tool. This allows you a way to sent alerts
if something fails in automated tests, to create spreadsheets with the
test results, to retain results in a database or SQLite3 file, or make
a custom tool to convert the data to something else like TAP (Test Anywhere
Protocol) reports.
<P>
An example program called "bookkeeper" is included that shows how to
parse the information passed to the program that generates several files:
<P>
<PRE>
   + bookkeeper.csv
   + bookkeeper.html
   + bookkeeper.nml
   + bookkeeper\_clicks.csv
<P>
</PRE>
To use the defaults you simply enter
<P>
<PRE>
    fpm test -- command=bookkeeper
<P>
</PRE>
The CSV files can typically be read directly into a spreadsheet program.
<P>
They can also be read using the SQLite3 tool. This is very powerful,
letting you use SQL to select specific data, generate reports, and
convert the subsequent results to HTML, CSV, flat text and other formats.
<P>
The NAMELIST output file is essentially a record of the harness calls
using the standardized NAMELIST format that is almost trivial to read
in with a custom Fortran program. This might be considered a metafile
format for a test run. You can replay the data and do whatever you want
with it including generating alternate output file types; plotting
timing data and so on.
<P>
The HTML file is handy for importing into word processors or viewing
via browsers. Example output files from an fpm(1) package that uses
M_framemaker illustrate the different types of output that can be
generated.

The last select generates a little tally table showing for all the runs
in the input DataBaseFile the number of pass, fail, and skips of the test
names. you could tally over a particular date range, only show failures,
display the last test status, generating output in HTML or CSV or &#46;&#46;&#46;
See the SQLite3 Tool documentation for sqlite3(3f) for more information.

     <H3>UNIQUE FEATURES</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
fpm(1), gdb(1), and M\_framework(3f) work together
<P>
It is easy to debug an individual test in a debugger. For example to run
a test called "crash" with gdb(1) use
<P>
<PRE>
     fpm test --target crash --runner "gdb -ex run --quiet"
<P>
</PRE>
A more elaborate example passing arguments to M\_framework(3f) to change
default behavior to for example write output to stdout instead of stderr
and display compiler version and options and to run all the tests in
the gdb(1) debugger (you can enter "q" after each test has run; or enter
gdb commands at the prompt):
<P>
<PRE>
    &gt; fpm test --target &#146;*&#146; --verbose \
    &gt; --runner &#146;gdb -ex "list, 0" -ex run --quiet --args&#146; \
    &gt; -- flags=9997,9998,9999 luns=6 level=3
<P>
</PRE>
This is long enough that an alias or script would facilitate its use,
with one changing it to use one&#146;s favorite options.
<P>
<PRE>
   EASILY CALLED BY STANDARDIZED CD/CI SCRIPTS
<P>
</PRE>
If a CD/CI github automated test script creates a Fortran
environment including fpm and simply calls "fpm test" you can standardize
your testing and use the same CD/CI scripts for any package. The testing
framework is designed with just that scenario in mind.
<P>
The .github subdirectory in M\_framework package contains examples of just
such files that you can copy as-is into your fpm project. Activate test
actions in your github repository after adding the .github directory and
your package will be automatically tested on several different platforms
by the scripts whenever a "push" to the repository occurs.

<P>
The impatient can try this, assuming git(1) and fpm(1) are installed.
<P>
Download the github repository and build it with fpm(1)
and create a test fpm(1) project:
<P>
<PRE>
   #!/bin/bash
   # first you need to install a few example programs
   cd /tmp
   git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_framework.git
   cd M_framework
   # install the "unit_test", "bookkeeper", and "test_suite"
   # example programs; assuming the default install puts
   # them in your path:
   fpm install
   # "fpm help install" describes how to customize where the
   # programs are installed.
   #
   # go to your fpm package test/ directory.
   # here, we will make one up
   fpm new /tmp/tryit  # create test project
   cd /tmp/tryit/test
   # so lets say you plan on adding procedures "a","b",and "c" to your src/tryit.f90
   # project code. Set up individual skeleton tests for each procedure.
   unit_test a b c                         # a file for each test
   test_suite a b c &gt; test_suite_tryit.f90 # or a single file
   cd ..  # go to the top of the project
   # add M_framework to the developer dependencies
   cat &gt;&gt; fpm.toml &lt;&lt;\EOF
   [dev-dependencies]
   M_framework    = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_framework.git" }

#
# test the package
fpm test
# if will say the procedures are untested. Put real calls
# in to unit_test(3f) and see how the default report
# changes
#
# so now to run the default tests is as simple as
fpm test
# run just one test
fpm test unit_test_a
# run tests using globbing; eg. all tests beginning with "unit\_"
fpm test &#146;unit_*&#146;
# display help on the interactive command options
fpm test -- <B>--help</B>
<P>
# you can pass parameters and/or change the unit_test_mode(3f)
# calls to change some of the test behavior
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
So once you want to use this on your own projects, you would normally
just add M\_framework(3f) as a developer dependency
in your fpm.toml project file and start making tests that call M\_framework(3f).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The optional programs demonstrated ("unit\_test", "test\_suite") are just simple
stand-alone programs that make skeleton programs to run tests that you can
customize (and rename too to avoid confusion).
<P>
<PRE>
   # some useful things to try. Check out the man-pages for all the unit_test_*(3f)
   # procedures.
   # Then look at
   unit_test --help
   fpm test -- help
   # run the demo bookkeeper script
   fpm test -- command=bookkeeper
   # and look at the bookkeeper*.* files in the top of the project

M_framework(3f) is subject to interface changes so the generally recommended
practice of using a specific commit when using it an an external
fpm(1) dependency is highly encouraged.
<P>
Any feedback (features, performance, ease of use, &#46;&#46;&#46;) is appreciated,
particularly in the ongoing development phase.
