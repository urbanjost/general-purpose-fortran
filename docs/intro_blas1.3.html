<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Level 1 BLAS perform basic vector-vector operations. The
following three types of vector-vector operations are available:
Routines for scaling, copying, swapping, and computing linear
combination of vectors.
Routines for computing dot products between vectors and various vector
norms.
Routines for generating or applying plane or modified plane rotations.
The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) were developed to enhance
the portability of published linear algebra codes. Because these
subprograms are portable, modular, self-documenting, and efficient,
you can incorporate them into your programs.
To realize the full power of the BLAS you must understand the
following three subjects:
- FORTRAN storage of arrays
- FORTRAN array argument association
- BLAS indexing conventions

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; FORTRAN storage of arrays</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Arrays in FORTRAN are stored in column major order. This means that
the eariler indexes in an array declaration toggle first. Consider
the following specifications:
DIMENSION A(N1,N2),B(N3)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
EQUIVALENCE (A,B)
where N3 = N1 * N2. Then A(I,J) is associated with the same memory
location as B(K) where
K = I + (J-1) * N1
This means that successive elements of a column of A are adjacent in
memory, while successive elements of a row of A are stored with a
difference of N1 storage units between them. Remember that the size
of a storage unit depends on the data type.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; FORTRAN array argument association</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When a FORTRAN subprogram is called with an array element as argument,
the value is not passed. Instead, the subprogram receives the address
in memory of the element. Consider the following code segment:
<PRE>
M=11
N=13
REAL A(M,N)
COL = 3
CALL SUBR (A(1,COL),M)
 .
 .
 .
SUBROUTINE SUBR (X,N)
REAL X(N)
 .
 .
 .
</PRE>
In this example, the subroutine SUBR is given the address of the first
element of the third column of A. Because it treats that argument as a
one-dimensional array, successive elements X(1), X(2), ..., occupy the
same memory locations as successive elements of the <I>third</I> column
of A: that is, A(1,3), A(2,3), .... Hence, the entire third column of
A is available to the subprogram.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; BLAS Indexing Conventions</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The rest of this section describes the topics of manipulating array
sections, dealing with stride arguments, and handling backward storage.
<P>
A vector description in BLAS is defined by three quantities:
- array or starting element within an array, for instance the variable
X or X(I,J)
- vector length or number of elements, for instance the variable N
- the increment, sometimes called the stride, that defines the number
of storage units <I>between</I> successive vector elements, for
instance the variable INCX.
The notation for describing a BLAS vector in calling a BLAS subroutine
is the triad (N,X,INCX). A few very brief examples follow. If X is a
one dimensional array of length N, then (N,X,1) represents forward
storage of X i.e. X(1), X(2), ..., X(N) and (N,X,-1) represents
backward
storage of X i.e. X(N), X(N-1), ..., X(1). If A is an M by N array,
then (M,A(1,J),1) represents column J and (N,A(I,1),M) represents row
I. Finally, if an M by N matrix is embedded in the upper left-hand
corner of an array B of size LDB by NMAX, then column J is
(M,B(1,J),1) and row I is (N,B(I,1),LDB). More specific details
follow.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Forward Storage</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As an example of the BLAS vector declaration using the above, suppose
that X represents a declared real array. Let N be the vector length
and let INCX be the increment. Suppose that a logical vector x with
components x(i), i = 1, 2,..., N, is to be stored in X. If INCX &gt;= 0,
then x(i) is stored in X(1 + (I-1) * INCX). This is known as forward
array storage starting at X(1) with stride equal to INCX, ending with
X(1 - (N-1) * INCX). Thus, if N = 4 and INCX = 2, the logical vector
x with components x(1), x(2), x(3), and x(4) are stored in memory in
the array elements X(1), X(3), X(5), and X(7), respectively.
This method of indexing, using a starting element, a number of
elements, and a stride, is especially useful for accessing
one-dimensional vectors in multidimensional arrays. For instance, if
A is defined as
REAL A(M,N)
Then to access the 2nd row of A, one uses forward storage with an
stride of M. Thus a BLAS routine call with
X=A(2,1)
and increment/stride of
INCX=M
will access A(2,i) for i = 1,2,...,N. To access the third column of A
in a BLAS routine call with
X=A(1,3)
and increment/stride of
INCX=1
This approach also works with multidimensional arrays. As an example,
if A is defined as
REAL A(M,N,P)
to access the P elements of A at row 3 and column 4 one could call a
BLAS routine with starting address X of
X=A(3,4,1)
and increment/stride of
INCX=M*N
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=6>

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Backward Storage</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some BLAS routines permit backward storage of vectors, which is
specified by using a negative increment INCX. If INCX &lt; 0, then x(i)
is stored "backwards" in X. Specifically x(i) is stored in X(1 +
(N-I) * |INCX|) or equivalently in X(1 - (N-I) * INCX). This is
called backward storage starting from X(1 - (N-1) * INCX) with stride
equal to INCX, ending with X(1). Thus, if N = 4 and INCX = -2, the
logical vector components x(1), x(2), x(3), and x(4) are stored in the
array elements X(7), X(5), X(3), and X(1), respectively.
Note: INCX = 0 is permitted by some BLAS routines and is not permitted
by others. When it is allowed, it means that logical vector x is a
vector of length N, all whose components are equal the value of X(1).

EXAMPLES
<P>
The following examples illustrate how to use increment arguments to
perform different operations with the same subprogram. These
<P>
EXAMPLES
<P>
use the BLAS function SDOT, with the following declarations:
<PRE>
INTEGER*4 N,INCX,INCY
REAL*4 SDOT,S,X(1+(N-1)*|INCX|),Y(1+(N-1)*|INCY|)
S = SDOT (N, X,INCX, Y,INCY)
</PRE>
This sets S to the dot product of the vectors (N,X,INCX) and
(N,Y,INCY).
Example 1: Compute the dot product T = X(1)*Y(1) + X(2)*Y(2) +
X(3)*Y(3) + X(4)*Y(4):
<PRE>
REAL*4 SDOT,T,X(4),Y(4)
T = SDOT (4, X,1, Y,1)
</PRE>
Example 2: Compute the convolution T = X(1)*Y(4) + X(2)*Y(3) +
X(3)*Y(2) + X(4)*Y(1):
<PRE>
REAL*4 SDOT,T,X(4),Y(4)
T = SDOT (4, X,1, Y,-1)
</PRE>
Example 3: Compute the dot product Y(2) = A(2,1)*X(1) + A(2,2)*X(2) +
A(2,3)*X(3),
which is the dot product of the second row of an M by 3 matrix A,
stored in a
10 by 3 array, with a 3-element vector X:
<PRE>
INTEGER*4 N,LDA
PARAMETER (LDA = 10)
REAL*4 SDOT,A(LDA,3),X(3),Y(LDA)
N = 3
Y(2) = SDOT (N, A(2,1),LDA, X,1)

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; FORTRAN type declaration for functions</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Always declare the data type of external functions. Declaring the
data type of the complex Level 1 BLAS functions is particularly
important because, based on the first letter of their names and the
Fortran data typing rules, the default implied data type would be
REAL.
Fortran type declarations for function names follow:
<PRE>

REAL                  SASUM, SCASUM, SCNRM2, SDOT, SNRM2, SSUM
