 1.0    Introduction
</h1>

<p>
   The  following  quotations,  taken directly from the "1967 ASME Steam Tables"
   published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, are thought to  be
   of significant value both as background, and for proper use of the ASME Steam
   Table  subroutines.   The  entire  introduction  is taken from the "1967 ASME
   Steam Tables" reference, except for the headings for Sections 1.1, 1.2.   and
   1.3.
</p>

<h3>
 1.1    From the Foreword:
</h3>

<p>
   The  publication of these new ASME Steam Tables represents the culmination of
   an  ASME  project  which  had  its  origin  in  1954  when,  at  the   Fourth
   International Conference on Properties of Steam held in Philadelphia, Pa., it
   was  decided  that  the  time  had  come  to  update  our  knowledge  of  the
   thermodynamic properties of steam.  Fortunately, the Society was able to take
   advantage of the experience of a number of its members who were involved in a
   similar venture more than thirty years earlier.
</p>

<p>
   Just   as   occurred   previously,   the   project   required  fund  raising,
   identification  and  technical  supervision  of  new  experimental  research,
   extensive  international  cooperation,  and  the  adoption of internationally
   accepted skeleton tables.  This time, however, the demand for standardization
   of design and performance calculations could not  be  satisfied  by  skeleton
   tables  alone.   International  agreement  had  to  be  reached  on  a set of
   equations which would reproduce these skeleton  tables,  provide  a  suitable
   interpolation  scheme,  and  yet  give  reasonable  computer  efficiency when
   incorporated in the already complex computer programs used day after day  for
   design and performance calculations.
</p>

<h3>
 1.2    From the Introduction:
</h3>

<p>
   The  First  International Conference on Properties of Steam, London, England,
   1929, concerned itself with a detailed examination of the tables of  specific
   volume  and  enthalpy  submitted  by  the  various national delegations.  The
   skeleton tables compiled at that conference served as the basis for the  1930
   ASME  Steam  Tables,  prepared  by  Professor J.  H.  Keenan and published by
   ASME.  This conference recognized that considerable  additional  measurements
   would  be  required  before  a  truly  satisfactory  representation  of these
   properties could be agreed upon.
</p>

<p>
   Progress was reviewed at the Second International Conference, held in Berlin,
   Germany,  in  1930, at which time, significant modifications were made in the
   skeleton tables.  The time, however, was not ripe for full  agreement.   Such
   agreement  was  reached in 1934 at the Third International Conference held in
   Washington, D.C., Cambridge, Mass., and New York, N.Y., with the adoption  of
   skeleton  tables giving the specific volume and enthalpy along the saturation
   line and at round values of  temperature  and  pressure  for  the  compressed
   liquid  and  superheated  vapor.   In  addition, each entry in the tables had
   associated with it a tolerance so that the two  values  would  "constitute  a
   criterion,  internationally  agreed  upon, by which, the reliability of steam
   tables may be judged".  The skeleton tables and the experimental measurements
   which led up to them served as the basis for a number  of  publications,  the
   most  prominent  of  which  was  the  Keenan and Keyes Steam Tables which had
   served as the vade mecum of engineers these past 30 years.
</p>

<p>
   The  need  was  recognized  for continued research on properties of steam and
   water by the Third International Conference, to an extent that  solicitations
   and  even  recorded  assurances  from  various  delegations  and institutions
   assured that the work on steam would be continued and extended.
</p>

<p>
   The  plan to hold a Fourth International Conference in Prague, Czechoslovakia
   gave way in time to more pressing problems brought on  by  the  Second  World
   War.   Almost  twenty  years  elapsed  before the thermodynamic properties of
   steam again became an active concern of the  Society  and  the  international
   scientific   and   engineering  community.   When  the  Fourth  International
   Conference was held  in  Philadelphia,  PA  in  1954,  it  was  evident  that
   technological  advances made in intervening years would require thermodynamic
   information outside of the temperature and pressure  range  of  the  existing
   steam tables.  The Society established a research committee on the Properties
   of  Steam,  and  charged  it  with the task of arranging for new research and
   reestablishing the program of international coordination, which had proved so
   fruitful two decades earlier.  The Society also accepted  the  invitation  to
   serve  as  the  permanent  Secretariat  for  the International Conferences on
   Properties of Steam.
</p>

<p>
   By  this  time,  interest  had  developed  in  Japan  and  the  U.S.S.R.   in
   thermodynamic  tables  for  steam  having  the  status  of  an  international
   standard.  Moreover, a considerable body of new experimental measurements had
   been  reported by a number of institutions in the Soviet Union.  Thus, at the
   time of the Fifth International Conference, London, 1956, it was evident that
   the work of examining the published data and  supervising  the  then  current
   research  could  be  handled  best  by  national  commissions  from  the four
   countries in which the major experimental research was being carried on.   It
   was  further  agreed,  that  the  national  Commissions  (Federal Republic of
   Germany, United Kingdom.  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the United
   States) would constitute  the  International  Coordinating  Committee  -  the
   working group of the Fifth International Conference.
</p>

<p>
   The  labors  of  the  International Coordinating Committee were rewarded at a
   plenary session of the Sixth International Conference on  the  Properties  of
   Steam,  New  York,  N.   Y.,  1963.   when  the  tables  were adopted as "The
   International Skeleton  Tables  of  1963".   The  temperature  range  of  the
   skeleton  tables is from 0 to 800 C and the pressure extends to 1000 bars - a
   considerable extension over the range of the 1934 Skeleton Tables.  Where new
   experimental data reflected refined  experimental  techniques,  they  are  in
   turn,  reflected  in  the narrower "tolerance" limits of the new tables.  The
   skeleton tables adopted by 16  member  nations  of  the  Sixth  International
   Conference, are  the  bases  for the  equations from  which these  ASME Steam
   Tables have been computed.
</p>

<p>
    Long  before  the  work  of  the  International  Coordinating  Committee  was
    completed, it was clear to most  members  of  the  working  groups  that  the
    skeleton tables alone did not insure the degree of reproducibility originally
    envisioned  for  design  and performance calculations owing to the relatively
    coarse grid of the skeleton tables and  to  the  requirements  of  performing
    numerical  differentiation  and  integration.   It became important to ensure
    that each country handled the numbers  in  the  same  way  when  it  came  to
    compiling  detailed  tables such as the following, or, when incorporating the
    skeleton  tables  into  a  computer  program  for  design   and   performance
    calculations.   The  Sixth  International  Conference  was  cognizant of this
    problem and established an International Formulation Committee (IFC) to:
</p>

<p>
    "Develop  at the earliest practical date a formulation for use with computers
    of the properties of steam as  they  are  represented  by  the  International
    Skeleton  Tables of 1963.  This formulation shall provide values that are, at
    all points, within the tolerances stated in the International Skeleton Tables
    of 1963, and shall be thermodynamically consistent."
</p>

<p>
    After  two  years  of sustained effort, during which delegates from Japan and
    Czechoslovakia joined those  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany,  United
    Kingdom,  United  States  of  America,  and  the  Union  of  Soviet Socialist
    Republics, a conference was held in Prague, at which  agreement  was  reached
    concerning the form and characteristics of the equations which would meet the
    requirements  laid  down by the Sixth International Conference.  A year later
    (March 1966), the IFC met in Glasgow,  Scotland.   After  much  deliberation,
    unanimous  agreement  was  reached  among  the  six national delegations on a
    formulation,  which,   after   some   post-conference   modifications.    was
    recommended to the members of the Sixth International Conference.
</p>

<p>
    While  it  was the general feeling of the IFC that the formulation did indeed
    satisfy the requirement for international standardization of steam tables for
    industrial use, it left much to be desired as a definitive equation of  state
    for  steam; thus, The "1967 IFC Formulation for Industrial Use: A Formulation
    of the Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance." Several of  the
    countries  participating in the Sixth International Conference are using this
    formulation to prepare more  detailed  tables  for  steam  and  water.   This
    formulation  is  the  basis for the thermodynamic tables and figures in these
    new ASME Steam Tables.
</p>

<p>
    The  Sixth  International  Conference  expanded  the scope of its activity by
    establishing a panel of experts to  develop  skeleton  tables  for  transport
    properties  (viscosity  and  thermal  conductivity of steam and water).  That
    panel completed its work at a meeting in Paris, France, in June 1964 and  the
    transport  properties  given  here  are  based on the skeleton tables and the
    empirical equations which they developed.
</p>

<hr> <!-- ================================================================== -->
<h3>
 1.3    From the 1967 Formulation for Industrial Use:
</h3>

</p>
    With  the  increasing  use  of digital computers, particularly in complicated
    calculations relating to plant design and cycle optimization, it  has  become
    necessary  to  have  a  formulation  of the thermodynamic properties of water
    substance convenient for industrial use.
</p>

</p>
    The  various thermodynamic properties are not independent of each other.  For
    example, when the pressure p and temperature T are chosen as the  independent
    variables   of   the  formulation,  then  expressions  (here  called  derived
    functions)  for  the  specific  volume,  entropy,  enthalpy  and  all   other
    thermodynamic  properties  may be derived directly by partial differentiation
    of the so-called canonical (or characteristic) function g = g (p, T) where  g
    is the specific free enthalpy (Gibbs function).  Similarly, when the specific
    volume  v  and  temperature  T  are chosen as the independent variables, then
    expressions for the  pressure,  specific  entropy,  enthalpy  and  all  other
    thermodynamic  properties  may be derived directly by partial differentiation
    of the canonical function f = f(v, T) where f is  the  specific  free  energy
    (Helmholtz  function).   The  formulation  is  presented  in  terms  of these
    canonical functions, thereby maintaining thermodynamic consistency.
</p>

<p>
    The canonical functions provide the definitive expression of the formulation.
    The  derived  functions  are  for  practical  use  and  are  secondary to the
    canonical functions.
</p>

<p>
    The  formulation  presented  herein describes the thermodynamic properties of
    ordinary water substance throughout the whole  of  the  region  that  extends
    pressure  from  the ideal-gas limit (at zero pressure) to a pressure of 10**8
    N/m**2 (1000 bar), and that extends in temperature from 273.16 K (0.01 C)  to
    1073.15 K(800 C).
</p>

<h3>
        DISCONTINUITIES AT BOUNDARIES BETWEEN SUBREGIONS <br>
        (See Figure 2 on next page)
</h3>

    It  should  be noted that there are discontinuities in property values at the
    boundary between subregions 2 and 3 and at the boundary between subregions  1
    and 4.  Nevertheless, for the specific volume, specific enthalpy and specific
    free enthalpy, the discontinuities are less than the maximum values which the
    First  Meeting  of  the  International  Formulation  Committee (Prague, 1965)
    recommended should not be exceeded.  However, when  values  of  the  specific
    entropy  are  listed  at  5-degree  intervals,  there  are four points on the
    boundary between subregions 2 and 3 at which the discontinuity has a value of
    0.3 J/kg K, and one point having a value of 0.4 J/kg K.   compared  with  the
    recommended maximum acceptable value of 0.2 J/kg K.
<p>

<h3>
        PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN NUMERICAL COMPUTATION
</h3>

    The  precautions  and  techniques of numerical analysis will be well known to
    users of this formulation.  Two points, however, warrant comment.
<p>

<ol>
       <li>  It will be clearly evident that, in order to attain an
             adequately precise result from numerical inversion in
             subregions 3 and 4, it is necessary to control the pressure
             error or the volume error, or both, within appropriate bounds.
             When pressure alone is controlled, very severe conditions must
             be imposed (possibly as fine as 1 part in 10**6 or, near the
             critical point, much finer).

       <li>  Note should be taken of the fact that errors may arise if
             finite-different techniques be used with too small an interval.

<h3>
 2.0    Validation of the ASME Steam Property Sub-Programs
</h3>

    Concurrent  with  the installation of the ASME Steam Property Sub-Programs as
    the standard PSCC 7600 steam property routines, a study of  the  validity  of
    these programs was begun.  The study had three primary purposes:
<p>

<ol>
       <li>  To compare sub-program results with the skeleton tables which
             appear in "1967 ASME Steam Tables", and to determine the quality of
             the results over their full range of applicability.

       <li>  To provide the necessary computer programs for the continued
             Quality Assurance of the ASME sub-programs.  The results of these
             programs will continue to be analyzed following ASME sub-program
             corrections, and other critical System changes.

       <li>  To provide the necessary information for new user documentation.
</ol>


<p>
        Two computer programs which have evolved from this study are:
<p>

<ol>
      <li>   A program which calculates steam properties at ASME skeleton table
             values of temperature and pressure, compares the sub-program
             results with the published skeleton table values, and tests to see
             that the difference between the sub-program result and the
             skeleton table value is within tolerance.  The program also
             produces plots of sub-program and skeleton table results.  In what
             follows this program will be referred to as the Skeleton Table
             Program.

      <li>   A program which produces three dimensional plots of the steam
             properties as functions of temperature and pressure.  This program
             will be called the 3-D Plot Program.
</ol>


<hr> <!-- ================================================================== -->
<h3>
 2.1    The Skeleton Table Program
</h3>

 This program performs the following three calculations:
<p>

<ol>
      <li>   Calculation of steam properties at skeleton values of pressure and
             temperature, and comparison of sub-program results with the
             published ASME values.  When more than one sub-program may be used
             to calculate the property, all sub-programs are tested.  In all
             cases, the original inputs for the calculation are pressure and
             temperature, so that when the function requires other inputs, an
             intermediate step is performed.  Thus, to calculate the enthalpy
             using the function sub-program HSSISS[*], the following steps are
             used:
<code>
<blockquote>
             C=HSS(P,T,S,V) to calculate S using P and T<br>
             H=HSSISS(P,S,T1,V1,X) to calculate the enthalpy, H, using P and S.<br>
</blockquote>
</code>

<p>
 *See Section 4 for a description of usage of the steam property sub-programs.
 Specifically see sections 4.4.9 and 4.4.11 for descriptions of HSS and HSSISS,
 respectively.
<p>

       <li>   Using each of the skeleton table pressures, each property is
             calculated at small increments of temperature - normally increments
             of 2 C.  Plots are produced using the character period (".") at 2 C
             increments, and using the character ("T") to represent ASME skeleton
             table values.

<p>
             Note that in Figure 1, an example of such a plot, the T's of the
             skeleton table values rest on the line generated by the periods,
             and hence agreement is perfect.

<p>
             Similar plots are produced by fixing temperature at each of the
             skeleton values, and varying pressure in small increments, over
             the entire pressure range.

<p>
             For purposes of Quality Assurance, checksums are calculated by
             summing plotted results for each fixed pressure and temperature.
             A total checksum for all properties is also calculated.
<p>

       <li>   Using the curves which are generated in 2), sub-program results
             are searched for local maximums and minimums.  (A local maximum is
             a point where the function value is greater than the two values
             immediately to the left and to the right, but which is not a
             genuine maximum of the property.  These maximum and minimums are
             actually small discontinuities.  All of the sub-programs produce
             such local variations when the pressure and temperature increments
             are 0.1.  However, most variations disappear when increments of
             1.0 are used.)
<p>

             Microfiche print and plot output of this program is available from
             Customer Services.
<p>

</ol>
<hr> <!-- ================================================================== -->

<h3>
 2.2    The 3-D Plot Program
</h3>

        This program performs the following functions:
<p>

<ol>
      <li>   Calculates sub-program results over a rectangular region, using
             input limits and increments of pressure and temperature.  In all
             cases, the original input arguments for the calculation are
             pressure and temperature.

      <li>   Plots the results of 1) three-dimensionally, using pressure and
             temperature as independent variables, and sub-program results as
             the dependent variable.  Figure 2 is the surface for Specific
             Isobaric Heat Capacity.

      <li>   If the sub-program outputs temperature, the original input

        Heat capacity is, in most cases, calculated by a numerical
        approximation of the derivative of enthalpy with respect to
        temperature.  However, in three small rectangular regions where this
        approximation undergoes non-trivial oscillations, linear interpolation
        of nearby values of heat capacity is used.  In addition, there are a
        few other regions where the numerical derivative displays gaps of as
        much as 8% from neighboring values, although the overall effect of the
        approximation is quite satisfactory.
<p>
        The calculation of heat capacity by numerical differentiation
        demonstrates two possible characteristics which must be considered for
        all of the ASME steam properties:
<p>

<ol>
<li>    There may be regions where the numerical derivative of the properties
        are discontinuous, or where the numerical derivative undergoes
        non-trivial oscillations.  Therefore, users are advised to investigate
        the behavior of the properties in their regions of application, before
        making use of a numerical derivative.  Programs are available to aid in
        these investigations (See Section 2.2).
<p>
<li>    The steam property sub-program results are generally very smooth, as
        evident from maximum discontinuities of only 8% in the heat capacity,
        over (almost) the entire range of temperature and pressure.  The
        irregularities of enthalpy, which cause the anomalies in heat capacity
        are so slight that they cannot be detected by close scrutiny of plots
        of enthalpy for constant pressure, and temperatures which vary in 1 C
        increments from 0 to 700 C (32 to 1292 F).
<p>
</ol>

 One further word on heat capacity is required.  Heat capacity should be
 considered to be undefined at the critical point, since it is unbounded within
 any neighborhood of the critical point.  The subroutines CPL and CPV, however,
 produce results which are continuous and comparatively large at and near the
 critical point.
<p>

<strong> <dt>

        There are four combinations of subroutines which may be used to
        calculate the specific volume over its full range of values.  These
        combinations are the use of VCL in the liquid region, and the use of
        CPV, HSS, HSSISS, or SSSISS in the steam and gas regions.  There are
        also four combinations which may be used to calculate enthalpy and
        entropy.  Generally, the property values which are calculated from
        these different combinations have been found to agree to six decimal
        places.  The significance of this agreement is best illustrated by an
        example.
<p>

        The specific volume V1 which is calculated by
<p>
<pre>

             C = HSS(P,T.S,V1)           to calculate V1

</pre>
        and the specific volume V2 which is calculated by
<p>
<pre>
             Q = HSS(P,T,S,V1)           to calculate S
                                         for P and T.

             C = HSSISS(P,S,T1,V2,M)     using above
                                         output S to
                                         calculate V2.
</pre>

        agree to six decimal places.  This example demonstrates a rather
        remarkable consistency of the results produced by HSS and HSSISS, a
        consistency which has been found to be generally true of the ASME
        sub-programs.

        Areas of slight fluctuation of results have been discovered in all of
        the properties.  These fluctuations are characterized by the occurrence
        of local maximums and minimums within very small intervals of
        temperature or pressure.  Again, these fluctuations cannot be detected
        by viewing a plot which covers the entire range of temperature or
        pressure.  As an example, the specific entropy at 550 C = 1022 F, has a
        local minimum of 5.06412 at 779.3 bars pressure, and a local maximum of
        5.06424 bars at 779.4 bars pressure.  However small these variations
        might appear, they could cause difficulties if the derivative is being
        approximated in this region as (S1-S0)/(P1-P0)[ editor's note: read this
        as "change-in-S/change-in-P"], and (P1-P0) is very small.  Generally
        these difficulties may be avoided by selecting a sufficiently large
        (P1-P0) or (T1-T0).  For example a (T1-T0)= 2 degrees F was selected to
        calculate values of specific heat as the derivative of enthalpy with
        respect to temperature.

        It is possible that a user may encounter problems with calculating

        The function PSV returns zero values for negative values of entropy.

        than .15%.  An exception to this is the property of entropy near
        pressures of zero, where the entropy has nearly zero (and sometimes
        negative) values.  In this case |D/S| can be as high as 50%.

        In the descriptions which follow, the regions of applicability together
        with minimum and maximum temperatures and pressures are given for each
        of the property sub-programs.  It is important to realize what these

<p>

<ol>
<li>
             The regions of applicability defined by "1967 ASME Steam Tables"
             published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

<li>
             The regions over which most of the sub-programs have been tested
             and quality assured by the programs described in Section 2.

<li>
             Regions beyond which the 1967 ASME tables do not define the
             behavior of the results.
</ol>

        They are not necessarily:
<p>

<ol>
<li>
             Regions outside of which error messages are or are not printed.

<li>
             Regions beyond which results are correct or incorrect.

        In summary, the results satisfy ASME requirements (within previously

</h3>

        All of the input and output arguments, as well as the function values
        of the steam property functions, are Fortran REAL values.  Input of
        infinite or indefinite arguments will cause the routines to abort with
        an arithmetic error.  All arguments, input and output, are Level 1,
        i.e., they must be assigned to small core storage.  Although some of
        the functions provide messages for out of range arguments, most of the
        responsibility of staying within limits lies with the user.  Since, in
        most cases, the limits are very generous, frequent use outside limits
        is not anticipated.
<p>

        It is generally true that functions with two input arguments and which
        end in L, must be used to compute property values in Region 1.
        Similarly, functions with two input arguments and which end in S or V,
        must be used in Region 2.
<p>

        In the descriptions which follow, Definition and Purpose define input
        and output arguments of the function.  When more than one variable
        appears on the left of the = sign, the first variable is the function
        value, and the remaining variables are output arguments.  The values in
        parentheses to the right of the = sign are the input arguments.

<h1>
   6.0   Use The STEAMV routine to verify the pedigree of the steam library
</h1>
<p>
   A routine  called  STEAMV  identifies  the origin of the steam library
   being used.  The first parameter identifies which FORTRAN unit number
   to write the  output on  (values  less than 0 cause the  output to be
   suppressed).
