<P>
<PRE>
  Fortran provides a means of referencing procedures that are defined by
  means of the C programming language or procedures that can be described
  by C prototypes as defined in 6.7.5.3 of the C International Standard,
  even if they are not actually defined by means of C. Conversely,
  there is a means of specifying that a procedure defined by a Fortran
  subprogram can be referenced from a function defined by means of
  C. In addition, there is a means of declaring global variables that
  are associated with C variables whose names have external linkage as
  defined in 6.2.2 of the C International Standard.
<P>
  The ISO C BINDING module provides access to named constants that
  represent kind type parameters of data representations compatible with
  C types. Fortran also provides facilities for defining derived types
  (4.5) and enumerations (4.6) that correspond to C types.
<P>
  To avoid potential name conflicts with program entities, it
  is recommended that a program use the ONLY option in any USE
  statement that references the ISO C BINDING intrinsic module.

<TR></TR><TR></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>CPTR</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
shall be a scalar of type C_PTR. It is an INTENT(IN) argument. Its value shall be
the C address of an interoperable data entity, or
the result of a reference to C_LOC with a noninteroperable argument.
The value of CPTR shall not be the C address of a Fortran variable that does not have the TARGET
attribute.

If the value of CPTR is the C address of an interoperable data entity, FPTR shall be a data pointer
with type and type parameters interoperable with the type of the entity. In this case, FPTR becomes
pointer associated with the target of CPTR. If FPTR is an array, its shape is specified by SHAPE
and each lower bound is 1.
If the value of CPTR is the result of a reference to C LOC with a noninteroperable argument X,
FPTR shall be a nonpolymorphic scalar pointer with the same type and type parameters as X. In
this case, X or its target if it is a pointer shall not have been deallocated or have become undefined
due to execution of a RETURN or END statement since the reference. FPTR becomes pointer
associated with X or its target.

<PRE>
  Description. Associate a procedure pointer with the target of a C function pointer.
<P>
  Class. Subroutine.
<P>
  Arguments.
<P>
  CPTR          shall be a scalar of type C_FUNPTR. It is an INTENT (IN) argument. Its value shall be the C
                address of a procedure that is interoperable.
  FPTR          shall be a procedure pointer, and shall not be a component of a coindexed object. It is an INTENT
                (OUT) argument. The interface for FPTR shall be interoperable with the prototype that describes
                the target of CPTR. FPTR becomes pointer associated with the target of CPTR.
<P>
    NOTE 15.4
<P>
        The term "target" in the descriptions of C F POINTER and C F PROCPOINTER denotes the entity
        referenced by a C pointer, as described in 6.2.5 of the C International Standard.
<P>
</PRE>
C_FUNLOC (X)
15.2.3.5
<P>
<PRE>
  Description. C address of the argument.
<P>
  Class. Inquiry function.
<P>
  Argument. X shall either be a procedure that is interoperable, or a procedure pointer associated with an
  interoperable procedure. It shall not be a coindexed object.
<P>
  Result Characteristics. Scalar of type C FUNPTR.
<P>
  Result Value. The result value is described using the result name FPTR. The result is determined as if
  C - FUNPTR were a derived type containing an implicit-interface procedure pointer component PX and the pointer
  assignment FPTR%PX =&gt; X were executed.
<P>
  The result is a value that can be used as an actual FPTR argument in a call to C F PROCPOINTER where
  FPTR has attributes that would allow the pointer assignment FPTR =&gt; X. Such a call to C F PROCPOINTER
  shall have the effect of the pointer assignment FPTR =&gt; X.
<P>
  15.2.3.6   C LOC (X)
<P>
  Description. C address of the argument.
<P>
  Class. Inquiry function.
<P>
  Argument. X shall have either the POINTER or TARGET attribute. It shall not be a coindexed object. It
  shall either be a contiguous variable with interoperable type and type parameters, or be a scalar, nonpolymorphic
  variable with no length type parameters. If it is allocatable, it shall be allocated. If it is a pointer, it shall be
  associated. If it is an array, it shall have nonzero size.
<P>
  Result Characteristics. Scalar of type C PTR.
<P>
  Result Value. The result value is described using the result name CPTR.
<P>
  If X is a scalar data entity, the result is determined as if C PTR were a derived type containing a scalar pointer
  component PX of the type and type parameters of X and the pointer assignment CPTR%PX =&gt; X were executed.
<P>
  If X is an array data entity, the result is determined as if C PTR were a derived type containing a scalar pointer
  component PX of the type and type parameters of X and the pointer assignment of CPTR%PX to the first
  element of X were executed.
<P>
  If X is a data entity that is interoperable or has interoperable type and type parameters, the result is the value
  that the C processor returns as the result of applying the unary "&" operator (as defined in the C International
  Standard, 6.5.3.2) to the target of CPTR%PX.
<P>
  The result is a value that can be used as an actual CPTR argument in a call to C F POINTER where FPTR
  has attributes that would allow the pointer assignment FPTR =&gt; X. Such a call to C F POINTER shall have

<P>
       NOTE 15.5
       Where the actual argument is of noninteroperable type or type parameters, the result of C LOC provides an
       opaque "handle" for it. In an actual implementation, this handle might be the C address of the argument;
       however, portable C functions should treat it as a void (generic) C pointer that cannot be dereferenced
       (6.5.3.2 in the C International Standard).

  15.2.3.7   C SIZEOF (X)
<P>
  Description. Size of X in bytes.
<P>
  Class. Inquiry function.
<P>
  Argument. X shall be an interoperable data entity that is not an assumed-size array.
<P>
  Result Characteristics. Scalar integer of kind C SIZE T (15.3.2).
<P>
  Result Value. If X is scalar, the result value is the value that the companion processor returns as the result of
  applying the sizeof operator (C International Standard, subclause 6.5.3.4) to an object of a type that interoperates
  with the type and type parameters of X.
<P>
  If X is an array, the result value is the value that the companion processor returns as the result of applying the
  sizeof operator to an object of a type that interoperates with the type and type parameters of X, multiplied by
  the number of elements in X.

  15.3       Interoperability between Fortran and C entities
<P>
  15.3.1     General
  Subclause 15.3 defines the conditions under which a Fortran entity is interoperable. If a Fortran entity is
  interoperable, an equivalent entity may be defined by means of C and the Fortran entity interoperates with the C
  entity. There does not have to be such an interoperating C entity.
<P>
       NOTE 15.6
       A Fortran entity can be interoperable with more than one C entity.
<P>
  15.3.2     Interoperability of intrinsic types
  Table 15.2 shows the interoperability between Fortran intrinsic types and C types. A Fortran intrinsic type
  with particular type parameter values is interoperable with a C type if the type and kind type parameter value
  are listed in the table on the same row as that C type; if the type is character, interoperability also requires
  that the length type parameter be omitted or be specified by an initialization expression whose value is one. A
  combination of Fortran type and type parameters that is interoperable with a C type listed in the table is also
  interoperable with any unqualified C type that is compatible with the listed C type.
<P>
  The second column of the table refers to the named constants made accessible by the ISO C BINDING intrinsic
  module. If the value of any of these named constants is negative, there is no combination of Fortran type and
  type parameters interoperable with the C type shown in that row.
<P>
  A combination of intrinsic type and type parameters is interoperable if it is interoperable with a C type. The
  C types mentioned in table 15.2 are defined in subclauses 6.2.5, 7.17, and 7.18.1 of the C International Standard.

<P>
      NOTE 15.7
      For example, the type integer with a kind type parameter of C_SHORT is interoperable with the C type
      short or any C type derived (via typedef) from short.
<P>
      NOTE 15.8
      The C International Standard specifies that the representations for nonnegative signed integers are the
      same as the corresponding values of unsigned integers. Because Fortran does not provide direct support for
      unsigned kinds of integers, the ISO C BINDING module does not make accessible named constants for their
      kind type parameter values. A user can use the signed kinds of integers to interoperate with the unsigned
      types and all their qualified versions as well. This has the potentially surprising side effect that the C type
      unsigned char is interoperable with the type integer with a kind type parameter of C SIGNED CHAR.
<P>
  15.3.3     Interoperability with C pointer types
  C PTR and C FUNPTR shall be derived types with only private components. No direct component of either of
  these types is allocatable or a pointer. C PTR is interoperable with any C object pointer type. C FUNPTR is
  interoperable with any C function pointer type.
<P>
       NOTE 15.9
       This implies that a C processor is required to have the same representation method for all C object pointer
       types and the same representation method for all C function pointer types if the C processor is to be
       the target of interoperability of a Fortran processor. The C International Standard does not impose this
       requirement.
<P>
       NOTE 15.10
       The function C LOC can be used to return a value of type C PTR that is the C address of an allocated
       allocatable variable. The function C FUNLOC can be used to return a value of type C FUNPTR that is
       the C address of a procedure. For C LOC and C FUNLOC the returned value is of an interoperable type
       and thus may be used in contexts where the procedure or allocatable variable is not directly allowed. For
       example, it could be passed as an actual argument to a C function.
<P>
       Similarly, type C FUNPTR or C PTR can be used in a dummy argument or structure component and can
       have a value that is the C address of a procedure or allocatable variable, even in contexts where a procedure
       or allocatable variable is not directly allowed.
<P>
  15.3.4     Interoperability of derived types and C struct types
  A Fortran derived type is interoperable if it has the BIND attribute.
<P>
  C1501 (R425) A derived type with the BIND attribute shall not have the SEQUENCE attribute.
<P>
  C1502 (R425) A derived type with the BIND attribute shall not have type parameters.
<P>
  C1503 (R425) A derived type with the BIND attribute shall not have the EXTENDS attribute.
<P>
  C1504 (R425) A derived type with the BIND attribute shall not have a type-bound-procedure-part.
<P>
  C1505 (R425) Each component of a derived type with the BIND attribute shall be a nonpointer, nonallocatable
        data component with interoperable type and type parameters.
<P>
       NOTE 15.11
       The syntax rules and their constraints require that a derived type that is interoperable have components
       that are all data entities that are interoperable. No component is permitted to be allocatable or a pointer,
       but the value of a component of type C FUNPTR or C PTR may be the C address of such an entity.
<P>
  A Fortran derived type is interoperable with a C struct type if the derived-type definition of the Fortran type
  specifies BIND(C) (4.5.2), the Fortran derived type and the C struct type have the same number of components,
  and the components of the Fortran derived type have types and type parameters that are interoperable with
  the types of the corresponding components of the C struct type. A component of a Fortran derived type and
  a component of a C struct type correspond if they are declared in the same relative position in their respective
  type definitions.
<P>
       NOTE 15.12
       The names of the corresponding components of the derived type and the C struct type need not be the
       same.
<P>
  There is no Fortran type that is interoperable with a C struct type that contains a bit field or that contains a
  flexible array member. There is no Fortran type that is interoperable with a C union type.
<P>
        NOTE 15.13
        For example, the C type myctype, declared below, is interoperable with the Fortran type myftype, declared
        below.

<P>
The names of the types and the names of the components are not significant for the purposes of determining
whether a Fortran derived type is interoperable with a C struct type.
<P>
NOTE 15.14
The C International Standard requires the names and component names to be the same in order for the types
to be compatible (C International Standard, subclause 6.2.7). This is similar to Fortran&#146;s rule describing
when different derived type definitions describe the same sequence type. This rule was not extended to
determine whether a Fortran derived type is interoperable with a C struct type because the case of identifiers
is significant in C but not in Fortran.

NOTE 15.22
The interoperability of Fortran procedure interfaces with C function prototypes is only one part of invocation
of a C function from Fortran. There are four pieces to consider in such an invocation: the procedure
reference, the Fortran procedure interface, the C function prototype, and the C function. Conversely,
the invocation of a Fortran procedure from C involves the function reference, the C function prototype,
the Fortran procedure interface, and the Fortran procedure. In order to determine whether a reference is
allowed, it is necessary to consider all four pieces.

General
A C variable whose name has external linkage may interoperate with a common block or with a variable declared
in the scope of a module. The common block or variable shall be specified to have the BIND attribute.
</TD></TR>
<TR></TR></TABLE>At most one variable that is associated with a particular C variable whose name has external linkage is permitted
to be declared within all the Fortran program units of a program. A variable shall not be initially defined by
more than one processor.
<P>
If a common block is specified in a BIND statement, it shall be specified in a BIND statement with the same
binding label in each scoping unit in which it is declared. A C variable whose name has external linkage interoperates
with a common block that has been specified in a BIND statement
if the C variable is of a struct type and the variables that are members of the common block are interoperable
with corresponding components of the struct type, or
if the common block contains a single variable, and the variable is interoperable with the C variable.
<P>
There does not have to be an associated C entity for a Fortran entity with the BIND attribute.
<P>
<PRE>
       NOTE 15.23
       The following are examples of the usage of the BIND attribute for variables and for a common block.
       The Fortran variables, C EXTERN and C2, interoperate with the C variables, c extern and myVariable,
       respectively. The Fortran common blocks, COM and SINGLE, interoperate with the C variables, com and
       single, respectively.

Binding labels for common blocks and variables
The binding label of a variable or common block is a default character value that specifies the name by which
the variable or common block is known to the companion processor.
<P>
If a variable or common block has the BIND attribute with the NAME= specifier and the value of its expression,
after discarding leading and trailing blanks, has nonzero length, the variable or common block has this as its
binding label. The case of letters in the binding label is significant. If a variable or common block has the BIND
attribute specified without a NAME= specifier, the binding label is the same as the name of the entity using
lower case letters. Otherwise, the variable or common block has no binding label.
<P>
The binding label of a C variable whose name has external linkage is the same as the name of the C variable.
A Fortran variable or common block with the BIND attribute that has the same binding label as a C variable
whose name has external linkage is linkage associated (16.5.1.5) with that variable.

Definition and reference of interoperable procedures
A procedure that is interoperable may be defined either by means other than Fortran or by means of a Fortran
subprogram, but not both.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
If the procedure is defined by means other than Fortran, it shall
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
<PRE>
        be describable by a C prototype that is interoperable with the interface,
        have a name that has external linkage as defined by 6.2.2 of the C International Standard, and
        have the same binding label as the interface.
<P>
</PRE>
A reference to such a procedure causes the function described by the C prototype to be called as specified in the
C International Standard.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
A reference in C to a procedure that has the BIND attribute, has the same binding label, and is defined by means
of Fortran, causes the Fortran procedure to be invoked.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
A procedure defined by means of Fortran shall not invoke setjmp or longjmp (C International Standard, 7.13).
If a procedure defined by means other than Fortran invokes setjmp or longjmp, that procedure shall not cause
any procedure defined by means of Fortran to be invoked. A procedure defined by means of Fortran shall not be
invoked as a signal handler (C International Standard, 7.14.1).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
If a procedure defined by means of Fortran and a procedure defined by means other than Fortran perform
input/output operations on the same external file, the results are processor dependent (9.5.4).

Binding labels for procedures
The binding label of a procedure is a default character value that specifies the name by which a procedure with
the BIND attribute is known to the companion processor.
</TD></TR>
<TR></TR></TABLE>If a procedure has the BIND attribute with the NAME= specifier and the value of its expression, after discarding
leading and trailing blanks, has nonzero length, the procedure has this as its binding label. The case of letters
in the binding label is significant. If a procedure has the BIND attribute with no NAME= specifier, and the
procedure is not a dummy procedure, internal procedure, or procedure pointer, then the binding label of the
procedure is the same as the name of the procedure using lower case letters. Otherwise, the procedure has no
binding label.
<P>
C1506 A procedure defined in a submodule shall not have a binding label unless its interface is declared in the
ancestor module.
<P>
The binding label for a C function whose name has external linkage is the same as the C function name.

<PRE>
       NOTE 15.24
       In the following sample, the binding label of C SUB is "c_sub", and the binding label of C FUNC is
       "C_funC".

<P>
The C International Standard permits functions to have names that are not permitted as Fortran names;
it also distinguishes between names that would be considered as the same name in Fortran. For example,
a C name may begin with an underscore, and C names that differ in case are distinct names.
<P>
The specification of a binding label allows a program to use a Fortran name to refer to a procedure defined
by a companion processor.

Exceptions and IEEE arithmetic procedures
A procedure defined by means other than Fortran shall not use signal (C International Standard, 7.14.1) to change
the handling of any exception that is being handled by the Fortran processor.
<P>
A procedure defined by means other than Fortran shall not alter the floating-point status (14.7) other than by
setting an exception flag to signaling.
<P>
The values of the floating-point exception flags on entry to a procedure defined by means other than Fortran are
processor-dependent.
