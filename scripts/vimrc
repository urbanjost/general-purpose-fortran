" There is fortran folding implemented in the /usr/share/vim/syntax/fortran.vim syntax module.
" Just look at :help fortran -> Syntax folding of fortran files
" It requires that you explicitly enable fortran folding by
let fortran_fold=1
" Additionally you can force folding on conditionals and multiline comments trhough
let fortran_fold_conditionals=1
let fortran_fold_multilinecomments=1
" Folding will then work with the usual foldmethod=syntax setting.
