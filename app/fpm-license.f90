'want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new    ',&

'improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they         ',&
'receive widespread use, become available for other developers to        ',&
'incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and        ',&
'encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of       ',&
'software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.   ',&
'The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and    ',&

'users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on  ',&
'a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source     ',&

'  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not        ',&

'them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you    ',&
'want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new    ',&

'  For the developers'' and authors'' protection, the GPL clearly explains',&
'that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users'' and  ',&
'authors'' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as     ',&
'changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to    ',&

'  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run       ',&
'modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer ',&
'can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of           ',&
'protecting users'' freedom to change the software.  The systematic       ',&
'pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to  ',&
'use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we    ',&
'have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those ',&
'products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we     ',&
'stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions ',&

'  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.   ',&
'States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of       ',&
'software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to  ',&
'avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could    ',&
'make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that  ',&
'patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.                   ',&

'  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some    ',&
'specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the   ',&
'Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You ',&
'can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether',&
'this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better     ',&
'strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.',&
'                                                                        ',&
'  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,   ',&
'not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that  ',&
'you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge  ',&
'for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get  ',&
'it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of   ',&
'it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do      ',&
'these things.                                                           ',&
'                                                                        ',&
'  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid      ',&
'distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these  ',&
'rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for   ',&
'you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.        ',&
'                                                                        ',&
'  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis  ',&
'or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave  ',&
'you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source  ',&
'code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide        ',&
'complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them   ',&
'with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling    ',&
'it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.      ',&
'                                                                        ',&
'  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the   ',&
'library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal       ',&
'permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.               ',&
'                                                                        ',&
'  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that       ',&
'there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is     ',&
'modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know      ',&
'that what they have is not the original version, so that the original   ',&
'author''s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be     ',&
'introduced by others.                                                   ',&
'                                                                        ',&
'  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of  ',&
'any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot           ',&
'effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a         ',&
'restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that    ',&
'any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be        ',&
'consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.      ',&
'                                                                        ',&
'  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the        ',&
'ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser      ',&
'General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and    ',&
'is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use    ',&
'this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those     ',&
'libraries into non-free programs.                                       ',&
'                                                                        ',&
'  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using  ',&
'a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a      ',&
'combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary      ',&
'General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the       ',&
'entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General    ',&
'Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with    ',&
'the library.                                                            ',&
'                                                                        ',&
'  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it   ',&
'does Less to protect the user''s freedom than the ordinary General      ',&
'Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less   ',&
'of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages  ',&
'are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many      ',&
'libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain  ',&
'special circumstances.                                                  ',&
'                                                                        ',&
'  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to        ',&
'encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes',&
'a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be          ',&
'allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free          ',&
'library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this     ',&
'case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free        ',&
'software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.               ',&
'                                                                          ',&
'  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free      ',&
'programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of        ',&
'free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in       ',&
'non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU           ',&
'operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating         ',&
'system.                                                                   ',&
'                                                                          ',&
'  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the    ',&
'users'' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is        ',&
'linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run        ',&
'that program using a modified version of the Library.                     ',&
'                                                                          ',&
'  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and          ',&
'modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a     ',&
'"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The      ',&
'former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must    ',&

'    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has     ',&
'    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the            ',&
'    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any              ',&

'sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you        ',&

'this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so       ',&
'that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,    ',&

'  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the          ',&

'  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library        ',&
