!!##NAME
!!    manup(1f) - [DEVELOPER] Simple markup of text to a man(1) page
!!    (LICENSE:PD)
!!
!!##SYNOPSIS
!!
!!    manup FILE -cmd title -section N --product "product name" -help .F. --version .F.
!!
!!##DESCRIPTION
!!   This program is being extended. It currently essentially
!!      o converts uppercase lines title sections
!!      o leaves lines indented more than four characters as-is
!!      o takes other text and builds it into paragraphs delimited by
!!        blank lines in the input file.
!!##OPTIONS
!!      FILE
!!         The input filename
!!
!!      -section N  N is the man(1) section number. Typically the following
!!                  categories are used:
!!
!!                  User Commands(1)      Executable programs or shell commands
!!                  System Calls(2)       System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
!!                  Library Calls(3)      Library calls (functions within program libraries)
!!                  Special Files(4)      Special files (usually found in /dev)
!!                  File Formats(5)       File formats and conventions (eg. /etc/passwd)
!!                  Games(6)  Games
!!                  Miscellaneous(7)      Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
!!                  System Admin.(8)      System administration commands (usually only for root)
!!                  Kernel Extensions(9)  Kernel routines [Non standard]
!!
!!                  See the man(1) page for man(1) for further details.
!!
!!      -title      title for manpage header
!!      -product    description for manpage header
!!      -asis       no formatting except for header lines.
!!
!!      -help       display help and exit
!!      -version    display version information and exit
!!##EXAMPLE
!!
!!  Given an input file such as
!!
!!    >NAME
!!    >        yes(1f) - [FUNIX] output a string repeatedly until killed or limit is reached
!!    >
!!    >SYNOPSIS
!!    >       yes [STRING] -help -version [-repeat N]
!!    >
!!    >DESCRIPTION
!!    >       yes(1) prints the command line arguments, separated by spaces
!!    >       and followed by a newline until the repeat count is reached or
!!    >       endlessly until it is killed. If no arguments are given, it prints
!!    >       ''y'' followed by a newline endlessly until killed. Upon a write
!!    >       error, yes(1) exits with status "1".
!!    >
!!    >              -repeat N  specify number of times to display string
!!    >              --help     display this help and exit
!!    >              --version  output version information and exit
!!    >
!!    >       To output an argument that begins with -, precede it with --, e.g.,
!!    >
!!    >              yes -- --help.
!!    >
!!    >EXAMPLES
!!    >       Sample commands
!!    >
!!    >              # repeat a command 20 times, pausing and clearing:
!!    >              yes  date --repeat 20  |xargs -iXX  sh -c ''XX;sleep 2;clear''
!!    >

!
!      bold text          type exactly as shown.
!      italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
!      [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
!      -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
!      argument ...       argument is repeatable.
!      [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.
!
!   Exact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able  to  render  italics
!   when running in a terminal, and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.
!
!   The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advis
!   able to illustrate several exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

!     the line (or the text in the next input line if there is no
!     argument to .SH) in  bold  face  (or  the  font specified  by
!     the string HF), one size larger than the base document size.
!     Additionally, the left margin and the indentation for the

! .SY command
!     Begin synopsis.  Takes a single argument, the name of a command.  Text following, until closed by .YS, is set with
!     a hanging indentation with the width of command plus a space.  This produces the traditional look of a  Unix  com-
!     mand synopsis.
! .YS    This macro restores normal indentation at the end of a command synopsis.

!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!       A manual page consists of several sections.
!
!       Conventional  section  names  include  NAME,  SYNOPSIS,  CONFIGURATION,  DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE,
!       ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT, FILES, VERSIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
!OPTIONS
!       The man macros understand the following command line options (which define various registers).
!
!       -rcR=1 This option (the default if in nroff mode) creates a single, very long page instead of multiple pages.  Say -rcR=0
!              to disable it.
!
!              Set line length.  If this option is not given, the line length is set to respect any value set by  a  prior  `.ll'
!              request  (which  must be in effect when the `.TH' macro is invoked), if this differs from the built-in default for
!              the formatter; otherwise it defaults to 78n in nroff mode and 6.5i in troff mode.
!
!              Note that the use of a `.ll' request to initialize the line length is supported for  backward  compatibility  with
!              some versions of the man program; direct initialization of the `LL' register should always be preferred to the use
!              of such a request.  In particular, note that a `.ll 65n' request does not preserve the normal nroff  default  line
!              length,  (the  man  default  initialization  to  78n  prevails),  whereas, the `-rLL=65n' option, or an equivalent
!              `.nr LL 65n' request preceding the use of the `TH' macro, does set a line length of 65n.
!
!USAGE
!       This  section  describes  the  available  macros  for manual pages.  For further customization, put additional macros and
!       requests into the file man.local, which is loaded immediately after the man package.
!
!       .EX
!       .EE    Example/End Example.  After .EX, filling is disabled and the font is set to constant-width.  This  is  useful  for
!              formatting  code, command, and configuration-file examples.  The EE macro restores filling and restores the previ-
!              ous font.
!
!       .IP [designator] [nnn]
!              Set  up  an indented paragraph, using designator as a tag to mark its beginning.  The indentation is set to nnn if
!              that argument is supplied (the default unit is `n' if omitted), otherwise it is set to  the  previous  indentation
!              value specified with .TP, .IP, or .HP (or to the default value if none of them have been used yet).  Font size and
!              face of the paragraph (but not the designator) are reset to its default values.
!
!              To start an indented paragraph with a particular indentation but without a designator, use `""' (two doublequotes)
!              as the second argument.
!
!              For  example,  the  following  paragraphs were all set up with bullets as the designator, using `.IP \(bu 4'.  The
!              whole block has been enclosed with .RS and .RE to set the left  margin  temporarily  to  the  current  indentation
!              value.
!
!              o   IP is one of the three macros used in the man package to format lists.
!
!              o   HP is another.  This macro produces a paragraph with a left hanging indentation.
!
!              o   TP is another.  This macro produces an unindented label followed by an indented paragraph.
!
!       .LP
!       .PP
!       .P     These  macros are mutual aliases.  Any of them causes a line break at the current position, followed by a vertical
!              space downwards by the amount specified by the PD macro.  The font size and shape are reset to the  default  value
!              (normally 10pt Roman).  Finally, the current left margin and the indentation is reset to the default values.
!
!       .RE [nnn]
!              This  macro moves the left margin back to level nnn, restoring the previous left margin.  If no argument is given,
!              it moves one level back.  The first level (i.e., no call to .RS yet) has number 1, and each call to .RS  increases
!              the level by 1.
!
!       .RS [nnn]
!              This macro moves the left margin to the right by the value nnn if specified (default unit is `n'); otherwise it is
!              set to the previous indentation value specified with .TP, .IP, or .HP (or to the default value  if  none  of  them
!              have been used yet).  The indentation value is then set to the default.
!
!              Calls to the RS macro can be nested.
!
!
!       .SS [text for a heading]
!              Set up a secondary, unnumbered section heading.  Prints out all the text following .SS up to the end of  the  line
!              (or  the  text  in  the next input line if there is no argument to .SS) in bold face (or the font specified by the
!              string HF), at the same size as the base document size.  Additionally, the left margin and the indentation for the
!              following text is reset to the default values.
!
!
!       .TP [nnn]
!              Set up an indented paragraph with label.  The indentation is set to nnn if that argument is supplied (the  default
!              unit is `n' if omitted), otherwise it is set to the previous indentation value specified with .TP, .IP, or .HP (or
!              to the default value if none of them have been used yet).
!
!              The first input line of text following this macro is interpreted as a string to be printed flush-left,  as  it  is
!              appropriate  for  a label.  It is not interpreted as part of a paragraph, so there is no attempt to fill the first
!              line with text from the following input lines.  Nevertheless, if the label is not as wide as the  indentation  the
!              paragraph  starts  at the same line (but indented), continuing on the following lines.  If the label is wider than
!              the indentation the descriptive part of the paragraph begins on the line following the label,  entirely  indented.
!              Note  that neither font shape nor font size of the label is set to a default value; on the other hand, the rest of
!              the text has default font settings.
!
!              The TP macro is the macro used for the explanations you are just reading.
!
!       .TQ    The TQ macro sets up header continuation for a TP macro.  With it, you can stack up any number of labels (such  as
!              in a glossary, or list of commands) before beginning the indented paragraph.  For an example, look up the documen-
!              tation of the LP, PP, and P macros.
!
!              This macro is not defined on legacy Unix systems running classic troff.  To be certain your page will be  portable
!              to those systems, copy its definition from the an-ext.tmac file of a groff installation.
!
!       To  summarize,  the following macros cause a line break with the insertion of vertical space (which amount can be changed
!       with the PD macro): SH, SS, TP, TQ, LP (PP, P), IP, and HP.  The macros RS, RE, EX, and EE also  cause  a  break  but  no
!       insertion of vertical space.
!
!MACROS TO SET FONTS
!       The standard font is Roman; the default text size is 10 point.
!
!       .B [text]
!              Causes  text  to appear in bold face.  If no text is present on the line where the macro is called the text of the
!              next input line appears in bold face.
!
!       .BI text
!              Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in bold face and italic.  The text must be on the same line  as
!              the macro call.  Thus
!
!                     .BI this "word and" that
!
!              would cause `this' and `that' to appear in bold face, while `word and' appears in italics.
!
!       .BR text
!              Causes  text  on the same line to appear alternately in bold face and roman.  The text must be on the same line as
!              the macro call.
!
!       .I [text]
!              Causes text to appear in italic.  If no text is present on the line where the macro is called the text of the next
!              input line appears in italic.
!
!       .IB text
!              Causes text to appear alternately in italic and bold face.  The text must be on the same line as the macro call.
!
!       .IR text
!              Causes  text on the same line to appear alternately in italic and roman.  The text must be on the same line as the
!              macro call.
!
!       .RB text
!              Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in roman and bold face.  The text must be on the same  line  as
!              the macro call.
!
!       .RI text
!              Causes  text on the same line to appear alternately in roman and italic.  The text must be on the same line as the
!              macro call.
!
!       .SB [text]
!              Causes the text on the same line or the text on the next input line to appear in boldface  font,  one  point  size
!              smaller than the default font.
!
!       .SM [text]
!              Causes  the  text  on  the same line or the text on the next input line to appear in a font that is one point size
!              smaller than the default font.
!
!MACROS TO DESCRIBE HYPERLINKS AND EMAIL ADDRESSES
!       The following macros are not defined on legacy Unix systems running classic troff.  To be certain your page will be  por-
!       table to those systems, copy their definitions from the an-ext.tmac file of a groff installation.
!
!       Using  these  macros helps ensure that you get hyperlinks when your manual page is rendered in a browser or other program
!       that is Web-enabled.
!
!       .MT address
!       .ME [punctuation]
!              Wrap an email address.  The argument of .MT is the address; text following, until .ME, is a name to be  associated
!              with  the address.  Any argument to the ME macro is pasted to the end of the link text.  On a device that is not a
!              browser,
!
!                     contact
!                     .MT fred.foonly@\:fubar.net
!                     Fred Foonly
!                     .ME
!                     for more information
!
!              usually displays like this: "contact Fred Foonly <fred.foonly@fubar.net> for more information".

!MACROS TO DESCRIBE COMMAND SYNOPSES
!       The  following macros are not defined on legacy Unix systems running classic troff.  To be certain your page will be por-
!       table to those systems, copy their definitions from the an-ext.tmac file of a groff installation.
!
!       These macros are a convenience for authors.  They also assist automated translation tools and help browsers in  recogniz-
!       ing command synopses and treating them differently from running text.
!
!       .OP key value
!              Describe  an  optional  command  argument.  The arguments of this macro are set surrounded by option braces in the
!              default Roman font; the first argument is printed with a bold face,  while  the  second  argument  is  typeset  as
!              italic.
!
!
!MISCELLANEOUS
!
!       .BT    Print the footer string.  Redefine this macro to get control of the footer.
!
!       .PT    Print the header string.  Redefine this macro to get control of the header.
!
!       The following strings are defined:
!
!       \*R    The `registered' sign.
!
!       \*S    Switch back to the default font size.
!
!       \*(lq
!       \*(rq  Left and right quote.  This is equal to `\(lq' and `\(rq\[cq], respectively.
!
!       \*(HF  The typeface used to print headings and subheadings.  The default is `B'.
!
!       \*(Tm  The `trademark' sign.
!
!       If a preprocessor like tbl or eqn is needed, it has become common to make the first line of the man page look like this:
!
!              '\" word
!
!       Note  the  single space character after the double quote.  word consists of letters for the needed preprocessors: `e' for
!       eqn, `r' for refer, and `t' for tbl.  Modern implementations of the man program read this first  line  and  automatically
!       call the right preprocessor(s).
!
!PORTABILITY AND TROFF REQUESTS
!       Since  the man macros consist of groups of groff requests, one can, in principle, supplement the functionality of the man
!       macros with individual groff requests where necessary.  See the  groff  info  pages  for  a  complete  reference  of  all
!       requests.
!
!       Note, however, that using raw troff requests is likely to make your page render poorly on the (increasingly common) class
!       of viewers that render it to HTML.  Troff requests make implicit assumptions about things like character and  page  sizes
!       that  may  break in an HTML environment; also, many of these viewers don't interpret the full troff vocabulary, a problem
!       that can lead to portions of your text being silently dropped.
!
!       For portability to modern viewers, it is best to write your page entirely in the requests described on this  page.   Fur-
!       ther, it is best to completely avoid those we have described as `presentation-level' (.HP, .PD, and .DT).
!
!       The  macros  we have described as extensions (.EX/.EE, .SY/.OP/.YS, .UR/.UE, and .MT/.ME) should be used with caution, as
!       they may not yet be built in to some viewer that is important to your audience.  If in  doubt,  copy  the  implementation
!       onto your page.

!DESCRIPTION
!     A complete reference for writing UNIX manual pages with the -mdoc macro package; a content-based and domain-based format-
!     ting package for GNU troff(1).  Its predecessor, the -man(7) package, addressed page layout leaving the manipulation of
!     fonts and other typesetting details to the individual author.  In -mdoc, page layout macros make up the page structure
!     domain which consists of macros for titles, section headers, displays and lists - essentially items which affect the physi-
!     cal position of text on a formatted page.  In addition to the page structure domain, there are two more domains, the manual
!     domain and the general text domain.  The general text domain is defined as macros which perform tasks such as quoting or
!     emphasizing pieces of text.  The manual domain is defined as macros that are a subset of the day to day informal language
!     used to describe commands, routines and related UNIX files.  Macros in the manual domain handle command names, command line
!     arguments and options, function names, function parameters, pathnames, variables, cross references to other manual pages,
!     and so on.  These domain items have value for both the author and the future user of the manual page.  Hopefully, the con-
!     sistency gained across the manual set will provide easier translation to future documentation tools.
!
!     Throughout the UNIX manual pages, a manual entry is simply referred to as a man page, regardless of actual length and with-
!     out sexist intention.

!TROFF IDIOSYNCRASIES
!     The -mdoc package attempts to simplify the process of writing a man page.  Theoretically, one should not have to learn the
!     tricky details of GNU troff(1) to use -mdoc; however, there are a few limitations which are unavoidable and best gotten out
!     of the way.  And, too, be forewarned, this package is not fast.
!
!   Macro Usage
!     As in GNU troff(1), a macro is called by placing a `.' (dot character) at the beginning of a line followed by the two-char-
!     acter (or three-character) name for the macro.  There can be space or tab characters between the dot and the macro name.
!     Arguments may follow the macro separated by spaces (but no tabs).  It is the dot character at the beginning of the line
!     which causes GNU troff(1) to interpret the next two (or more) characters as a macro name.  A single starting dot followed
!     by nothing is ignored.  To place a `.' (dot character) at the beginning of an input line in some context other than a macro
!     invocation, precede the `.' (dot) with the `\&' escape sequence which translates literally to a zero-width space, and is
!     never displayed in the output.
!
!     In general, GNU troff(1) macros accept an unlimited number of arguments (contrary to other versions of troff which can't
!     handle more than nine arguments).  In limited cases, arguments may be continued or extended on the next line (See Extended
!     Arguments below).  Almost all macros handle quoted arguments (see Passing Space Characters in an Argument below).
!
!     Most of the -mdoc general text domain and manual domain macros are special in that their argument lists are parsed for
!     callable macro names.  This means an argument on the argument list which matches a general text or manual domain macro name
!     (and which is defined to be callable) will be executed or called when it is processed.  In this case the argument, although
!     the name of a macro, is not preceded by a `.' (dot).  This makes it possible to nest macros; for example the option macro,
!     `.Op', may call the flag and argument macros, `Fl' and `Ar', to specify an optional flag with an argument:
!
!           [-s bytes]  is produced by `.Op Fl s Ar bytes'
!
!     To prevent a string from being interpreted as a macro name, precede the string with the escape sequence `\&':
!
!           [Fl s Ar bytes]  is produced by `.Op \&Fl s \&Ar bytes'
!
!     Here the strings `Fl' and `Ar' are not interpreted as macros.  Macros whose argument lists are parsed for callable argu-
!     ments are referred to as parsed and macros which may be called from an argument list are referred to as callable throughout
!     this document.  This is a technical faux pas as almost all of the macros in -mdoc are parsed, but as it was cumbersome to
!     constantly refer to macros as being callable and being able to call other macros, the term parsed has been used.
!
!     In the following, we call an -mdoc macro which starts a line (with a leading dot) a command if this distinction is neces-
!     sary.
!
!   Passing Space Characters in an Argument
!     Sometimes it is desirable to give as an argument a string containing one or more blank space characters, say, to specify
!     arguments to commands which expect particular arrangement of items in the argument list.  Additionally, it makes -mdoc
!     working faster.  For example, the function command `.Fn' expects the first argument to be the name of a function and any
!     remaining arguments to be function parameters.  As ANSI C stipulates the declaration of function parameters in the paren-
!     thesized parameter list, each parameter is guaranteed to be at minimum a two word string.  For example, int foo.
!
!     There are two possible ways to pass an argument which contains an embedded space.  One way of passing a string containing
!     blank spaces is to use the hard or unpaddable space character `\ ', that is, a blank space preceded by the escape character
!     `\'.  This method may be used with any macro but has the side effect of interfering with the adjustment of text over the
!     length of a line.  Troff sees the hard space as if it were any other printable character and cannot split the string into
!     blank or newline separated pieces as one would expect.  This method is useful for strings which are not expected to overlap
!     a line boundary.  An alternative is to use `\~', a paddable (i.e. stretchable), unbreakable space (this is a GNU troff(1)
!     extension).  The second method is to enclose the string with double quotes.
!
!     For example:
!
!           fetch(char *str)  is created by `.Fn fetch char\ *str'
!
!           fetch(char *str)  can also be created by `.Fn fetch "char *str"'
!
!     If the `\' before the space in the first example or double quotes in the second example were omitted, `.Fn' would see three
!     arguments, and the result would be:
!
!           fetch(char, *str)
!
!   Trailing Blank Space Characters
!     Troff can be confused by blank space characters at the end of a line.  It is a wise preventive measure to globally remove
!     all blank spaces from <blank-space><end-of-line> character sequences.  Should the need arise to use a blank character at
!     the end of a line, it may be forced with an unpaddable space and the `\&' escape character.  For example, `string\ \&'.
!
!   Escaping Special Characters
!     Special characters like the newline character `\n' are handled by replacing the `\' with `\e' (e.g. `\en') to preserve the
!     backslash.
!
!   Other Possible Pitfalls
!     A warning is emitted when an empty input line is found outside of displays (see below).  Use `.sp' instead.  (Well, it is
!     even better to use -mdoc macros to avoid the usage of low-level commands.)
!
!     Leading spaces will cause a break and are output directly.  Avoid this behaviour if possible.  Similarly, do not use more
!     than one space character between words in an ordinary text line; contrary to other text formatters, they are not replaced
!     with a single space.
!
!     You can't pass `"' directly as an argument.  Use `\*[q]' (or `\*q') instead.
!
!     By default, troff(1) inserts two space characters after a punctuation mark closing a sentence; characters like `)' or `''
!     are treated transparently, not influencing the sentence-ending behaviour.  To change this, insert `\&' before or after the
!     dot:
!
!           The
!           .Ql .
!           character.
!           .Pp
!           The
!           .Ql \&.
!           character.
!           .Pp
!           .No test .
!           test
!           .Pp
!           .No test.
!           test
!
!     gives
!
!           The `'.  character
!
!           The `.' character.
!
!           test.  test
!
!           test. test
!
!     As can be seen in the first and third line, -mdoc handles punctuation characters specially in macro arguments.  This will
!     be explained in section General Syntax below.  In the same way, you have to protect trailing full stops of abbreviations
!     with a trailing zero-width space: `e.g.\&'.
!
!     A comment in the source file of a man page can be either started with `.\"' on a single line, `\"' after some input, or
!     `\#' anywhere (the latter is a GNU troff(1) extension); the rest of such a line is ignored.
!
!A MANUAL PAGE TEMPLATE
!     The body of a man page is easily constructed from a basic template:
!
!           .\" The following commands are required for all man pages.
!           .Dd Month day, year

!           .\" .Sh BUGS
!
!     The first items in the template are the commands `.Dd', `.Dt', and `.Os'; the document date, the operating system the man
!     page or subject source is developed or modified for, and the man page title (in upper case) along with the section of the
!     manual the page belongs in.  These commands identify the page and are discussed below in TITLE MACROS.
!
!     The remaining items in the template are section headers (.Sh); of which NAME, SYNOPSIS, and DESCRIPTION are mandatory.  The
!     headers are discussed in PAGE STRUCTURE DOMAIN, after presentation of MANUAL DOMAIN.  Several content macros are used to
!     demonstrate page layout macros; reading about content macros before page layout macros is recommended.
!
!CONVENTIONS
!     In the description of all macros below, optional arguments are put into brackets.  An ellipsis (`...') represents zero or
!     more additional arguments.  Alternative values for a parameter are separated with `|'.  If there are alternative values for
!     a mandatory parameter, braces are used (together with `|') to enclose the value set.  Meta-variables are specified within
!     angles.
!
!     Example:
!
!           .Xx <foo> {bar1 | bar2} [-test1 [-test2 | -test3]] ...
!
!     Except stated explicitly, all macros are parsed and callable.
!
!     Note that a macro takes effect up to the next nested macro.  For example, `.Ic foo Aq bar' doesn't produce `foo <bar>' but
!     `foo <bar>'.  Consequently, a warning message is emitted for most commands if the first argument is a macro itself since it
!     cancels the effect of the calling command completely.  Another consequence is that quoting macros never insert literal
!     quotes; `foo <bar>' has been produced by `.Ic "foo <bar>"'.
!
!     Most macros have a default width value which can be used to specify a label width (-width) or offset (-offset) for the
!     `.Bl' and `.Bd' macros.  It is recommended not to use this rather obscure feature to avoid dependencies on local modifica-
!     tions of the -mdoc package.
!
!TITLE MACROS
!     The title macros are part of the page structure domain but are presented first and separately for someone who wishes to
!     start writing a man page yesterday.  Three header macros designate the document title or manual page title, the operating
!     system, and the date of authorship.  These macros are called once at the very beginning of the document and are used to
!     construct headers and footers only.
!
!     .Dt [<document title>] [<section number>] [<volume>]
!             The document title is the subject of the man page and must be in CAPITALS due to troff limitations.  If omitted,
!             `UNTITLED' is used.  The section number may be a number in the range 1, ..., 9 or `unass', `draft', or `paper'.  If
!             it is specified, and no volume name is given, a default volume name is used.
!
!             Under BSD, the following sections are defined:

!             For compatibility, `MMI' can be used for `IND', and `LOC' for `LOCAL'.  Values from the previous table will specify
!             a new volume name.  If the third parameter is a keyword designating a computer architecture, its value is prepended
!             to the default volume name as specified by the second parameter.  By default, the following architecture keywords
!             are defined:

!
!             If the section number is neither a numeric expression in the range 1 to 9 nor one of the above described keywords,
!             the third parameter is used verbatim as the volume name.
!
!             In the following examples, the left (which is identical to the right) and the middle part of the manual page header
!             strings are shown.  Note how `\&' prevents the digit 7 from being a valid numeric expression.
!
!                   .Dt FOO 7       `FOO(7)' `BSD Miscellaneous Information Manual'
!                   .Dt FOO 7 bar   `FOO(7)' `BSD Miscellaneous Information Manual'

!
!             Local, OS-specific additions might be found in the file mdoc.local; look for strings named `volume-ds-XXX' (for the
!             former type) and `volume-as-XXX' (for the latter type); `XXX' then denotes the keyword to be used with the `.Dt'
!             macro.
!
!             This macro is neither callable nor parsed.
!
!     .Os [<operating system>] [<release>]
!             If the first parameter is empty, the default `BSD' is used.  This may be overridden in the local configuration
!             file, mdoc.local.  In general, the name of the operating system should be the common acronym, e.g. BSD or ATT.  The
!             release should be the standard release nomenclature for the system specified.  In the following table, the possible
!             second arguments for some predefined operating systems are listed.  Similar to `.Dt', local additions might be
!             defined in mdoc.local; look for strings named `operating-system-XXX-YYY', where `XXX' is the acronym for the oper-
!             ating system and `YYY' the release ID.

!             For ATT, an unknown second parameter will be replaced with the string UNIX; for the other predefined acronyms it

!             For instance, a typical footer might be:
!
!                   .Os BSD 4.3
!
!             giving `4.3 Berkeley Distribution', or for a locally produced set

!                   .Os CS Department
!
!             which will produce `CS Department'.

!
!     .Dd [<month> <day>, <year>]
!             If `Dd' has no arguments, `Epoch' is used for the date string.  If it has exactly three arguments, they are con-
!             catenated, separated with unbreakable space:
!
!                   .Dd January 25, 2001
!
!             The month's name shall not be abbreviated.
!
!             With any other number of arguments, the current date is used, ignoring the parameters.
!
!             As a special exception, the format
!
!                   .Dd $Mdocdate: <month> <day> <year> $
!
!             is also recognized.  It is used in OpenBSD manuals to automatically insert the current date when committing.
!
!             This macro is neither callable nor parsed.

!INTRODUCTION OF MANUAL AND GENERAL TEXT DOMAINS
!   What's in a Name...
!     The manual domain macro names are derived from the day to day informal language used to describe commands, subroutines and
!     related files.  Slightly different variations of this language are used to describe the three different aspects of writing
!     a man page.  First, there is the description of -mdoc macro command usage.  Second is the description of a UNIX command
!     with -mdoc macros, and third, the description of a command to a user in the verbal sense; that is, discussion of a command
!     in the text of a man page.
!
!     In the first case, troff(1) macros are themselves a type of command; the general syntax for a troff command is:
!
!           .Xx argument1 argument2 ...
!
!     `.Xx' is a macro command, and anything following it are arguments to be processed.  In the second case, the description of
!     a UNIX command using the content macros is a bit more involved; a typical SYNOPSIS command line might be displayed as:
!
!           filter [-flag] <infile> <outfile>
!
!     Here, filter is the command name and the bracketed string -flag is a flag argument designated as optional by the option
!     brackets.  In -mdoc terms, <infile> and <outfile> are called meta arguments; in this example, the user has to replace the
!     meta expressions given in angle brackets with real file names.  Note that in this document meta arguments are used to
!     describe -mdoc commands; in most man pages, meta variables are not specifically written with angle brackets.  The macros
!     which formatted the above example:
!
!           .Nm filter
!           .Op Fl flag
!           .Ao Ar infile Ac Ao Ar outfile Ac
!
!     In the third case, discussion of commands and command syntax includes both examples above, but may add more detail.  The
!     arguments <infile> and <outfile> from the example above might be referred to as operands or file arguments.  Some command
!     line argument lists are quite long:
!
!           make  [-eiknqrstv] [-D variable] [-d flags] [-f makefile] [-I directory] [-j max_jobs] [variable=value] [target ...]
!
!     Here one might talk about the command make and qualify the argument, makefile, as an argument to the flag, -f, or discuss
!     the optional file operand target.  In the verbal context, such detail can prevent confusion, however the -mdoc package does
!     not have a macro for an argument to a flag.  Instead the `Ar' argument macro is used for an operand or file argument like
!     target as well as an argument to a flag like variable.  The make command line was produced from:
!
!           .Nm make
!           .Op Fl eiknqrstv
!           .Op Fl D Ar variable
!           .Op Fl d Ar flags
!           .Op Fl f Ar makefile
!           .Op Fl I Ar directory
!           .Op Fl j Ar max_jobs
!           .Op Ar variable Ns = Ns Ar value
!           .Bk
!           .Op Ar target ...
!           .Ek
!
!     The `.Bk' and `.Ek' macros are explained in Keeps.
!
!   General Syntax
!     The manual domain and general text domain macros share a similar syntax with a few minor deviations; most notably, `.Ar',
!     `.Fl', `.Nm', and `.Pa' differ only when called without arguments; and `.Fn' and `.Xr' impose an order on their argument
!     lists.  All content macros are capable of recognizing and properly handling punctuation, provided each punctuation charac-
!     ter is separated by a leading space.  If a command is given:
!
!           .Ar sptr, ptr),
!
!     The result is:
!
!           sptr, ptr),
!
!     The punctuation is not recognized and all is output in the font used by `.Ar'.  If the punctuation is separated by a lead-
!     ing white space:
!
!           .Ar sptr , ptr ) ,
!
!     The result is:
!
!           sptr, ptr),
!
!     The punctuation is now recognized and output in the default font distinguishing it from the argument strings.  To remove
!     the special meaning from a punctuation character escape it with `\&'.
!
!     The following punctuation characters are recognized by -mdoc:
!
!               .         ,         :         ;         (
!               )         [         ]         ?         !
!
!     Troff is limited as a macro language, and has difficulty when presented with a string containing a member of the mathemati-
!     cal, logical or quotation set:
!
!                 {+,-,/,*,%,<,>,<=,>=,=,==,&,`,',"}
!
!     The problem is that troff may assume it is supposed to actually perform the operation or evaluation suggested by the char-
!     acters.  To prevent the accidental evaluation of these characters, escape them with `\&'.  Typical syntax is shown in the
!     first content macro displayed below, `.Ad'.
!
!MANUAL DOMAIN
!   Addresses
!     The address macro identifies an address construct.
!
!           Usage: .Ad <address> ...
!
!                    .Ad addr1           addr1
!                    .Ad addr1 .         addr1.
!                    .Ad addr1 , file2   addr1, file2
!                    .Ad f1 , f2 , f3 :  f1, f2, f3:
!                    .Ad addr ) ) ,      addr)),
!
!     The default width is 12n.
!
!   Author Name
!     The `.An' macro is used to specify the name of the author of the item being documented, or the name of the author of the
!     actual manual page.
!
!           Usage: .An <author name> ...
!
!                    .An "Joe Author"        Joe Author
!
!                    .An "Joe Author" ,      Joe Author,
!
!                    .An "Joe Author" Aq nobody@FreeBSD.org
!                                            Joe Author <nobody@FreeBSD.org>
!
!                    .An "Joe Author" ) ) ,  Joe Author)),
!
!     The default width is 12n.
!
!     In the AUTHORS section, the `.An' command causes a line break allowing each new name to appear on its own line.  If this is
!     not desirable,
!
!           .An -nosplit
!
!     call will turn this off.  To turn splitting back on, write
!
!           .An -split
!
!   Arguments
!     The .Ar argument macro may be used whenever an argument is referenced.  If called without arguments, the `file ...' string
!     is output.
!
!           Usage: .Ar [<argument>] ...
!
!                    .Ar              file ...
!                    .Ar file1        file1
!                    .Ar file1 .      file1.
!                    .Ar file1 file2  file1 file2
!                    .Ar f1 f2 f3 :   f1 f2 f3:
!                    .Ar file ) ) ,   file)),
!
!     The default width is 12n.
!
!   Configuration Declaration (Section Four Only)
!     The `.Cd' macro is used to demonstrate a config(8) declaration for a device interface in a section four manual.
!
!           Usage: .Cd <argument> ...
!
!                    .Cd "device le0 at scode?"  device le0 at scode?
!
!     In the SYNOPSIS section a `.Cd' command causes a line break before and after its arguments are printed.
!
!     The default width is 12n.
!
!   Command Modifiers
!     The command modifier is identical to the `.Fl' (flag) command with the exception that the `.Cm' macro does not assert a
!     dash in front of every argument.  Traditionally flags are marked by the preceding dash, however, some commands or subsets
!     of commands do not use them.  Command modifiers may also be specified in conjunction with interactive commands such as edi-
!     tor commands.  See Flags.
!
!     The default width is 10n.
!
!   Defined Variables
!     A variable (or constant) which is defined in an include file is specified by the macro `.Dv'.
!
!           Usage: .Dv <defined variable> ...
!
!                    .Dv MAXHOSTNAMELEN  MAXHOSTNAMELEN
!                    .Dv TIOCGPGRP )     TIOCGPGRP)
!
!     The default width is 12n.
!
!   Errno's
!     The `.Er' errno macro specifies the error return value for section 2, 3, and 9 library routines.  The second example below
!     shows `.Er' used with the `.Bq' general text domain macro, as it would be used in a section two manual page.
!
!           Usage: .Er <errno type> ...
!
!                    .Er ENOENT      ENOENT
!                    .Er ENOENT ) ;  ENOENT);
!                    .Bq Er ENOTDIR  [ENOTDIR]
!
!     The default width is 17n.
!
!   Environment Variables
!     The `.Ev' macro specifies an environment variable.
!
!           Usage: .Ev <argument> ...
!
!                    .Ev DISPLAY        DISPLAY
!                    .Ev PATH .         PATH.
!                    .Ev PRINTER ) ) ,  PRINTER)),
!
!     The default width is 15n.
!
!   Flags
!     The `.Fl' macro handles command line flags.  It prepends a dash, `-', to the flag.  For interactive command flags, which
!     are not prepended with a dash, the `.Cm' (command modifier) macro is identical, but without the dash.
!
!           Usage: .Fl <argument> ...
!
!                    .Fl          -
!                    .Fl cfv      -cfv
!                    .Fl cfv .    -cfv.
!                    .Cm cfv .    cfv.
!                    .Fl s v t    -s -v -t
!                    .Fl - ,      --,
!                    .Fl xyz ) ,  -xyz),
!                    .Fl |        - |
!
!     The `.Fl' macro without any arguments results in a dash representing stdin/stdout.  Note that giving `.Fl' a single dash
!     will result in two dashes.
!
!     The default width is 12n.
!
!   Function Declarations
!     The `.Fd' macro is used in the SYNOPSIS section with section two or three functions.  It is neither callable nor parsed.
!
!           Usage: .Fd <argument> ...
!
!                    .Fd "#include <sys/types.h>"  #include <sys/types.h>
!
!     In the SYNOPSIS section a `.Fd' command causes a line break if a function has already been presented and a break has not
!     occurred.  This leaves a nice vertical space in between the previous function call and the declaration for the next func-
!     tion.
!
!     The `.In' macro, while in the SYNOPSIS section, represents the #include statement, and is the short form of the above exam-
!     ple.  It specifies the C header file as being included in a C program.  It also causes a line break.
!
!     While not in the SYNOPSIS section, it represents the header file enclosed in angle brackets.
!
!           Usage: .In <header file>
!
!                    .In stdio.h  #include <stdio.h>
!                    .In stdio.h  <stdio.h>
!
!   Function Types
!     This macro is intended for the SYNOPSIS section.  It may be used anywhere else in the man page without problems, but its
!     main purpose is to present the function type in kernel normal form for the SYNOPSIS of sections two and three (it causes a
!     line break, allowing the function name to appear on the next line).
!
!           Usage: .Ft <type> ...
!
!                    .Ft struct stat  struct stat
!
!   Functions (Library Routines)
!     The `.Fn' macro is modeled on ANSI C conventions.
!
!           Usage: .Fn <function> [<parameter>] ...
!
!                    .Fn getchar              getchar()
!                    .Fn strlen ) ,           strlen()),
!                    .Fn align "char *ptr" ,  align(char *ptr),
!
!     Note that any call to another macro signals the end of the `.Fn' call (it will insert a closing parenthesis at that point).
!
!     For functions with many parameters (which is rare), the macros `.Fo' (function open) and `.Fc' (function close) may be used
!     with `.Fa' (function argument).
!
!     Example:
!
!           .Ft int
!           .Fo res_mkquery
!           .Fa "int op"
!           .Fa "char *dname"
!           .Fa "int class"
!           .Fa "int type"
!           .Fa "char *data"
!           .Fa "int datalen"
!           .Fa "struct rrec *newrr"
!           .Fa "char *buf"
!           .Fa "int buflen"
!           .Fc
!
!     Produces:
!
!           int res_mkquery(int op, char *dname, int class, int type, char *data, int datalen, struct rrec *newrr, char *buf,
!           int buflen)
!
!     In the SYNOPSIS section, the function will always begin at the beginning of line.  If there is more than one function pre-
!     sented in the SYNOPSIS section and a function type has not been given, a line break will occur, leaving a nice vertical
!     space between the current function name and the one prior.
!
!     The default width values of `.Fn' and `.Fo' are 12n and 16n, respectively.
!
!   Function Arguments
!     The `.Fa' macro is used to refer to function arguments (parameters) outside of the SYNOPSIS section of the manual or inside
!     the SYNOPSIS section if the enclosure macros `.Fo' and `.Fc' instead of `.Fn' are used.  `.Fa' may also be used to refer to
!     structure members.
!
!           Usage: .Fa <function argument> ...
!
!                    .Fa d_namlen ) ) ,  d_namlen)),
!                    .Fa iov_len         iov_len
!
!     The default width is 12n.
!
!   Return Values
!     The `.Rv' macro generates text for use in the RETURN VALUES section.
!
!           Usage: .Rv [-std] [<function> ...]
!
!     For example, `.Rv -std atexit' produces:
!
!           The atexit() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable
!           errno is set to indicate the error.
!
!     The -std option is valid only for manual page sections 2 and 3.  Currently, this macro does nothing if used without the
!     -std flag.
!
!   Exit Status
!     The `.Ex' macro generates text for use in the DIAGNOSTICS section.
!
!           Usage: .Ex [-std] [<utility> ...]
!
!     For example, `.Ex -std cat' produces:
!
!           The cat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
!
!     The -std option is valid only for manual page sections 1, 6 and 8.  Currently, this macro does nothing if used without the
!     -std flag.
!
!   Interactive Commands
!     The `.Ic' macro designates an interactive or internal command.
!
!           Usage: .Ic <argument> ...
!
!                    .Ic :wq                :wq
!                    .Ic "do while {...}"   do while {...}
!                    .Ic setenv , unsetenv  setenv, unsetenv
!
!     The default width is 12n.
!
!   Library Names
!     The `.Lb' macro is used to specify the library where a particular function is compiled in.
!
!           Usage: .Lb <argument> ...

!
!     Local, OS-specific additions might be found in the file mdoc.local; look for strings named `str-Lb-XXX'.  `XXX' then
!     denotes the keyword to be used with the `.Lb' macro.
!
!     In the LIBRARY section an `.Lb' command causes a line break before and after its arguments are printed.
!
!   Literals
!     The `.Li' literal macro may be used for special characters, variable constants, etc. - anything which should be displayed
!     as it would be typed.
!
!           Usage: .Li <argument> ...
!
!                    .Li \en          \n
!                    .Li M1 M2 M3 ;   M1 M2 M3;
!                    .Li cntrl-D ) ,  cntrl-D),
!                    .Li 1024 ...     1024 ...
!
!     The default width is 16n.
!
!   Names
!     The `.Nm' macro is used for the document title or subject name.  It has the peculiarity of remembering the first argument
!     it was called with, which should always be the subject name of the page.  When called without arguments, `.Nm' regurgitates
!     this initial name for the sole purpose of making less work for the author.  `.Nm' causes a line break within the SYNOPSIS
!     section.
!
!     Note: A section two or three document function name is addressed with the `.Nm' in the NAME section, and with `.Fn' in the
!     SYNOPSIS and remaining sections.  For interactive commands, such as the `while' command keyword in csh(1), the `.Ic' macro
!     should be used.  While `.Ic' is nearly identical to `.Nm', it can not recall the first argument it was invoked with.
!
!           Usage: .Nm [<argument>] ...
!
!                    .Nm groff_mdoc  groff_mdoc
!                    .Nm \-mdoc      -mdoc
!                    .Nm foo ) ) ,   foo)),
!                    .Nm :           groff_mdoc:
!
!     The default width is 10n.
!
!   Options
!     The `.Op' macro places option brackets around any remaining arguments on the command line, and places any trailing punctua-
!     tion outside the brackets.  The macros `.Oo' and `.Oc' (which produce an opening and a closing option bracket respectively)
!     may be used across one or more lines or to specify the exact position of the closing parenthesis.
!
!           Usage: .Op [<option>] ...
!
!                    .Op                                []
!                    .Op Fl k                           [-k]
!                    .Op Fl k ) .                       [-k]).
!                    .Op Fl k Ar kookfile               [-k kookfile]
!                    .Op Fl k Ar kookfile ,             [-k kookfile],
!                    .Op Ar objfil Op Ar corfil         [objfil [corfil]]
!                    .Op Fl c Ar objfil Op Ar corfil ,  [-c objfil [corfil]],
!                    .Op word1 word2                    [word1 word2]
!                    .Li .Op Oo Ao option Ac Oc ...     .Op [<option>] ...
!
!     Here a typical example of the `.Oo' and `.Oc' macros:
!
!           .Oo
!           .Op Fl k Ar kilobytes
!           .Op Fl i Ar interval
!           .Op Fl c Ar count
!           .Oc
!
!     Produces:
!
!           [[-k kilobytes] [-i interval] [-c count]]
!
!     The default width values of `.Op' and `.Oo' are 14n and 10n, respectively.
!
!   Pathnames
!     The `.Pa' macro formats path or file names.  If called without arguments, the `~' string is output, which represents the
!     current user's home directory.
!
!           Usage: .Pa [<pathname>] ...
!
!                    .Pa                    ~
!                    .Pa /usr/share         /usr/share
!                    .Pa /tmp/fooXXXXX ) .  /tmp/fooXXXXX).
!
!     The default width is 32n.
!
!   Standards
!
!   Variable Types
!     The `.Vt' macro may be used whenever a type is referenced.  In the SYNOPSIS section, it causes a line break (useful for old
!     style variable declarations).
!
!           Usage: .Vt <type> ...
!
!                    .Vt extern char *optarg ;  extern char *optarg;
!                    .Vt FILE *                 FILE *
!
!   Variables
!     Generic variable reference.
!
!           Usage: .Va <variable> ...
!
!                    .Va count             count
!                    .Va settimer ,        settimer,
!                    .Va "int *prt" ) :    int *prt):
!                    .Va "char s" ] ) ) ,  char s])),
!
!     The default width is 12n.
!
!   Manual Page Cross References
!     The `.Xr' macro expects the first argument to be a manual page name.  The optional second argument, if a string (defining
!     the manual section), is put into parentheses.
!
!           Usage: .Xr <man page name> [<section>] ...
!
!                    .Xr mdoc        mdoc
!                    .Xr mdoc ,      mdoc,
!                    .Xr mdoc 7      mdoc(7)
!                    .Xr xinit 1x ;  xinit(1x);
!
!     The default width is 10n.
!
!
!   Emphasis Macro
!     Text may be stressed or emphasized with the `.Em' macro.  The usual font for emphasis is italic.
!
!           Usage: .Em <argument> ...
!
!                    .Em does not          does not
!                    .Em exceed 1024 .     exceed 1024.
!                    .Em vide infra ) ) ,  vide infra)),
!
!     The default width is 10n.
!
!   Font Mode
!     The `.Bf' font mode must be ended with the `.Ef' macro (the latter takes no arguments).  Font modes may be nested within
!     other font modes.
!
!     `.Bf' has the following syntax:
!
!           .Bf <font mode>
!
!     <font mode> must be one of the following three types:
!
!           Em | -emphasis  Same as if the `.Em' macro was used for the entire block of text.
!           Li | -literal   Same as if the `.Li' macro was used for the entire block of text.
!           Sy | -symbolic  Same as if the `.Sy' macro was used for the entire block of text.
!
!     Both macros are neither callable nor parsed.
!
!   Enclosure and Quoting Macros
!     The concept of enclosure is similar to quoting.  The object being to enclose one or more strings between a pair of charac-
!     ters like quotes or parentheses.  The terms quoting and enclosure are used interchangeably throughout this document.  Most
!     of the one-line enclosure macros end in small letter `q' to give a hint of quoting, but there are a few irregularities.
!     For each enclosure macro there is also a pair of open and close macros which end in small letters `o' and `c' respectively.
!
!     Quote   Open   Close   Function                  Result
!

!
!     All macros ending with `q' and `o' have a default width value of 12n.
!
!     .Eo, .Ec  These macros expect the first argument to be the opening and closing strings respectively.
!
!     .Es, .En  Due to the nine-argument limit in the original troff program two other macros have been implemented which are now
!               rather obsolete: `.Es' takes the first and second parameter as the left and right enclosure string, which are
!               then used to enclose the arguments of `.En'.  The default width value is 12n for both macros.
!
!     .Eq       The first and second arguments of this macro are the opening and closing strings respectively, followed by the
!               arguments to be enclosed.
!
!     .Ql       The quoted literal macro behaves differently in troff and nroff mode.  If formatted with nroff, a quoted literal
!               is always quoted.  If formatted with troff, an item is only quoted if the width of the item is less than three
!               constant width characters.  This is to make short strings more visible where the font change to literal (constant
!               width) is less noticeable.
!
!               The default width is 16n.
!
!     .Pf       The prefix macro suppresses the whitespace between its first and second argument:
!
!                     .Pf ( Fa name2  (name2
!
!               The default width is 12n.
!
!               The `.Ns' macro (see below) performs the analogous suffix function.
!
!     .Ap       The `.Ap' macro inserts an apostrophe and exits any special text modes, continuing in `.No' mode.
!
!     Examples of quoting:

!           .Aq Pa ctype.h ) ,       <ctype.h>),

!
!     For a good example of nested enclosure macros, see the `.Op' option macro.  It was created from the same underlying enclo-
!     sure macros as those presented in the list above.  The `.Xo' and `.Xc' extended argument list macros are discussed below.
!
!   No-Op or Normal Text Macro
!     The `.No' macro can be used in a macro command line for parameters which should not be formatted.  Be careful to add `\&'
!     to the word `No' if you really want that English word (and not the macro) as a parameter.
!
!           Usage: .No <argument> ...
!
!                    .No test Ta with Ta tabs  test     with     tabs
!
!     The default width is 12n.
!
!   No-Space Macro
!     The `.Ns' macro suppresses insertion of a space between the current position and its first parameter.  For example, it is
!     useful for old style argument lists where there is no space between the flag and argument:
!
!           Usage: ... <argument> Ns [<argument>] ...
!                  .Ns <argument> ...
!
!                    .Op Fl I Ns Ar directory  [-Idirectory]
!
!     Note: The `.Ns' macro always invokes the `.No' macro after eliminating the space unless another macro name follows it.  If
!     used as a command (i.e., the second form above in the `Usage' line), `.Ns' is identical to `.No'.
!
!   Section Cross References
!     The `.Sx' macro designates a reference to a section header within the same document.
!
!           Usage: .Sx <section reference> ...
!
!                    .Sx FILES  FILES
!
!     The default width is 16n.
!
!   Symbolics
!     The symbolic emphasis macro is generally a boldface macro in either the symbolic sense or the traditional English usage.
!
!           Usage: .Sy <symbol> ...
!
!                    .Sy Important Notice  Important Notice
!
!     The default width is 6n.
!
!   Mathematical Symbols
!     Use this macro for mathematical symbols and similar things.
!
!           Usage: .Ms <math symbol> ...
!
!                    .Ms sigma  sigma
!
!     The default width is 6n.
!
!   References and Citations
!     The following macros make a modest attempt to handle references.  At best, the macros make it convenient to manually drop
!     in a subset of refer(1) style references.
!
!           .Rs     Reference start (does not take arguments).  Causes a line break in the SEE ALSO section and begins collection
!                   of reference information until the reference end macro is read.
!           .Re     Reference end (does not take arguments).  The reference is printed.
!           .%A     Reference author name; one name per invocation.
!           .%B     Book title.
!           .%C     City/place.
!           .%D     Date.
!           .%I     Issuer/publisher name.
!           .%J     Journal name.
!           .%N     Issue number.
!           .%O     Optional information.
!           .%P     Page number.
!           .%Q     Corporate or foreign author.
!           .%R     Report name.
!           .%T     Title of article.
!           .%U     Optional hypertext reference.
!           .%V     Volume.
!
!     Macros beginning with `%' are not callable but accept multiple arguments in the usual way.  Only the `.Tn' macro is handled
!     properly as a parameter; other macros will cause strange output.  `.%B' and `.%T' can be used outside of the `.Rs/.Re'
!     environment.
!
!     Example:
!
!           .Rs
!           .%A "Matthew Bar"
!           .%A "John Foo"
!           .%T "Implementation Notes on foobar(1)"

!           .%Q "Drofnats College"
!           .%C "Nowhere"
!           .%D "April 1991"
!           .Re
!
!     produces
!

!           Nowhere, April 1991.
!
!   Trade Names (or Acronyms and Type Names)
!     The trade name macro prints its arguments in a smaller font.  Its intended use is to imitate a small caps fonts for upper-
!     case acronyms.
!
!           Usage: .Tn <symbol> ...
!
!                    .Tn DEC    DEC
!                    .Tn ASCII  ASCII
!
!     The default width is 10n.
!
!   Extended Arguments
!     The .Xo and .Xc macros allow one to extend an argument list on a macro boundary for the `.It' macro (see below).  Note that
!     .Xo and .Xc are implemented similarly to all other macros opening and closing an enclosure (without inserting characters,
!     of course).  This means that the following is true for those macros also.
!
!     Here is an example of `.Xo' using the space mode macro to turn spacing off:
!
!           .Sm off
!           .It Xo Sy I Ar operation
!           .No \en Ar count No \en
!           .Xc
!           .Sm on
!
!     produces
!
!           Ioperation\ncount\n
!
!     Another one:
!
!           .Sm off
!           .It Cm S No / Ar old_pattern Xo
!           .No / Ar new_pattern
!           .No / Op Cm g
!           .Xc
!           .Sm on
!
!     produces
!
!           S/old_pattern/new_pattern/[g]
!
!     Another example of `.Xo' and enclosure macros: Test the value of a variable.
!
!           .It Xo
!           .Ic .ifndef
!           .Oo \&! Oc Ns Ar variable Oo
!           .Ar operator variable ...
!           .Oc Xc
!
!     produces
!
!           .ifndef [!]variable [operator variable ...]
!
!PAGE STRUCTURE DOMAIN
!   Section Headers
!     The following `.Sh' section header macros are required in every man page.  The remaining section headers are recommended at
!     the discretion of the author writing the manual page.  The `.Sh' macro is parsed but not generally callable.  It can be
!     used as an argument in a call to `.Sh' only; it then reactivates the default font for `.Sh'.
!
!     The default width is 8n.
!
!     .Sh NAME           The `.Sh NAME' macro is mandatory.  If not specified, headers, footers and page layout defaults will not
!                        be set and things will be rather unpleasant.  The NAME section consists of at least three items.  The
!                        first is the `.Nm' name macro naming the subject of the man page.  The second is the name description
!                        macro, `.Nd', which separates the subject name from the third item, which is the description.  The
!                        description should be the most terse and lucid possible, as the space available is small.
!
!                        `.Nd' first prints `-', then all its arguments.
!
!     .Sh LIBRARY        This section is for section two and three function calls.  It should consist of a single `.Lb' macro
!                        call; see Library Names.
!
!     .Sh SYNOPSIS       The SYNOPSIS section describes the typical usage of the subject of a man page.  The macros required are
!                        either `.Nm', `.Cd', or `.Fn' (and possibly `.Fo', `.Fc', `.Fd', and `.Ft').  The function name macro
!                        `.Fn' is required for manual page sections 2 and 3; the command and general name macro `.Nm' is required
!                        for sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  Section 4 manuals require a `.Nm', `.Fd' or a `.Cd' configuration
!                        device usage macro.  Several other macros may be necessary to produce the synopsis line as shown below:
!
!                              cat [-benstuv] [-] file ...
!
!                        The following macros were used:
!
!                              .Nm cat
!                              .Op Fl benstuv
!                              .Op Fl
!                              .Ar
!
!     .Sh DESCRIPTION    In most cases the first text in the DESCRIPTION section is a brief paragraph on the command, function or
!                        file, followed by a lexical list of options and respective explanations.  To create such a list, the
!                        `.Bl' (begin list), `.It' (list item) and `.El' (end list) macros are used (see Lists and Columns
!                        below).
!
!     .Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
!                        Implementation specific information should be placed here.
!
!     .Sh RETURN VALUES  Sections 2, 3 and 9 function return values should go here.  The `.Rv' macro may be used to generate text
!                        for use in the RETURN VALUES section for most section 2 and 3 library functions; see Return Values.
!
!     The following `.Sh' section headers are part of the preferred manual page layout and must be used appropriately to maintain
!     consistency.  They are listed in the order in which they would be used.
!
!     .Sh ENVIRONMENT    The ENVIRONMENT section should reveal any related environment variables and clues to their behavior
!                        and/or usage.
!
!     .Sh FILES          Files which are used or created by the man page subject should be listed via the `.Pa' macro in the
!                        FILES section.
!
!     .Sh EXAMPLES       There are several ways to create examples.  See the EXAMPLES section below for details.
!
!     .Sh DIAGNOSTICS    Diagnostic messages from a command should be placed in this section.  The `.Ex' macro may be used to
!                        generate text for use in the DIAGNOSTICS section for most section 1, 6 and 8 commands; see Exit Status.
!
!     .Sh COMPATIBILITY  Known compatibility issues (e.g. deprecated options or parameters) should be listed here.
!
!     .Sh ERRORS         Specific error handling, especially from library functions (man page sections 2, 3, and 9) should go
!                        here.  The `.Er' macro is used to specify an error (errno).
!
!     .Sh SEE ALSO       References to other material on the man page topic and cross references to other relevant man pages
!                        should be placed in the SEE ALSO section.  Cross references are specified using the `.Xr' macro.  Cur-
!                        rently refer(1) style references are not accommodated.
!
!                        It is recommended that the cross references are sorted on the section number, then alphabetically on the
!                        names within a section, and placed in that order and comma separated.  Example:
!
!                        ls(1), ps(1), group(5), passwd(5)
!
!     .Sh STANDARDS      If the command, library function or file adheres to a specific implementation such as IEEE Std 1003.2
!                        (``POSIX.2'') or ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C89'') this should be noted here.  If the command does not
!                        adhere to any standard, its history should be noted in the HISTORY section.
!
!     .Sh HISTORY        Any command which does not adhere to any specific standards should be outlined historically in this sec-
!                        tion.
!
!     .Sh AUTHORS        Credits should be placed here.  Use the `.An' macro for names and the `.Aq' macro for e-mail addresses
!                        within optional contact information.  Explicitly indicate whether the person authored the initial manual
!                        page or the software or whatever the person is being credited for.
!
!     .Sh BUGS           Blatant problems with the topic go here.
!
!     User-specified `.Sh' sections may be added; for example, this section was set with:
!
!                    .Sh "PAGE STRUCTURE DOMAIN"
!
!   Subsection Headers
!     Subsection headers have exactly the same syntax as section headers: `.Ss' is parsed but not generally callable.  It can be
!     used as an argument in a call to `.Ss' only; it then reactivates the default font for `.Ss'.
!
!     The default width is 8n.
!
!   Paragraphs and Line Spacing
!     .Pp  The `.Pp' paragraph command may be used to specify a line space where necessary.  The macro is not necessary after a
!          `.Sh' or `.Ss' macro or before a `.Bl' or `.Bd' macro (which both assert a vertical distance unless the -compact flag
!          is given).
!
!          The macro is neither callable nor parsed and takes no arguments; an alternative name is `.Lp'.
!
!   Keeps
!     The only keep that is implemented at this time is for words.  The macros are `.Bk' (begin keep) and `.Ek' (end keep).  The
!     only option that `.Bk' accepts currently is -words (this is also the default if no option is given) which is useful for
!     preventing line breaks in the middle of options.  In the example for the make command line arguments (see What's in a
!     Name), the keep prevented nroff from placing up the flag and the argument on separate lines.
!
!     Both macros are neither callable nor parsed.
!
!     More work needs to be done with the keep macros; specifically, a -line option should be added.
!
!   Examples and Displays
!     There are seven types of displays.
!
!     .D1  (This is D-one.)  Display one line of indented text.  This macro is parsed but not callable.
!
!                -ldghfstru
!
!          The above was produced by: .D1 Fl ldghfstru.
!
!     .Dl  (This is D-ell.)  Display one line of indented literal text.  The `.Dl' example macro has been used throughout this
!          file.  It allows the indentation (display) of one line of text.  Its default font is set to constant width (literal).
!          `.Dl' is parsed but not callable.
!
!                % ls -ldg /usr/local/bin
!
!          The above was produced by: .Dl % ls \-ldg /usr/local/bin.
!
!     .Bd  Begin display.  The `.Bd' display must be ended with the `.Ed' macro.  It has the following syntax:
!
!                .Bd {-literal | -filled | -unfilled | -ragged | -centered} [-offset <string>] [-file <file name>] [-compact]
!
!          -ragged            Fill, but do not adjust the right margin (only left-justify).
!          -centered          Center lines between the current left and right margin.  Note that each single line is centered.
!          -unfilled          Do not fill; display a block of text as typed, using line breaks as specified by the user.  This
!                             can produce overlong lines without warning messages.
!          -filled            Display a filled block.  The block of text is formatted (i.e., the text is justified on both the
!                             left and right side).
!          -literal           Display block with literal font (usually fixed-width).  Useful for source code or simple tabbed or
!                             spaced text.
!          -file <file name>  The file whose name follows the -file flag is read and displayed before any data enclosed with
!                             `.Bd' and `.Ed', using the selected display type.  Any troff/-mdoc commands in the file will be
!                             processed.
!          -offset <string>   If -offset is specified with one of the following strings, the string is interpreted to indicate
!                             the level of indentation for the forthcoming block of text:
!
!                             left        Align block on the current left margin; this is the default mode of `.Bd'.
!                             center      Supposedly center the block.  At this time unfortunately, the block merely gets left
!                                         aligned about an imaginary center margin.
!                             indent      Indent by one default indent value or tab.  The default indent value is also used for
!                                         the `.D1' and `.Dl' macros, so one is guaranteed the two types of displays will line
!                                         up.  The indentation value is normally set to 6n or about two thirds of an inch (six
!                                         constant width characters).
!                             indent-two  Indent two times the default indent value.
!                             right       This left aligns the block about two inches from the right side of the page.  This

!                             If <string> is a valid numeric expression instead (with a scale indicator other than `u'), use that
!                             value for indentation.  The most useful scale indicators are `m' and `n', specifying the so-called
!                             Em and En square.  This is approximately the width of the letters `m' and `n' respectively of the
!                             current font (for nroff output, both scale indicators give the same values).  If <string> isn't a
!                             numeric expression, it is tested whether it is an -mdoc macro name, and the default offset value
!                             associated with this macro is used.  Finally, if all tests fail, the width of <string> (typeset
!                             with a fixed-width font) is taken as the offset.
!          -compact           Suppress insertion of vertical space before begin of display.
!
!     .Ed  End display (takes no arguments).
!
!   Lists and Columns
!     There are several types of lists which may be initiated with the `.Bl' begin-list macro.  Items within the list are speci-
!     fied with the `.It' item macro, and each list must end with the `.El' macro.  Lists may be nested within themselves and
!     within displays.  The use of columns inside of lists or lists inside of columns is unproven.
!
!     In addition, several list attributes may be specified such as the width of a tag, the list offset, and compactness (blank
!     lines between items allowed or disallowed).  Most of this document has been formatted with a tag style list (-tag).
!
!     It has the following syntax forms:
!
!           .Bl {-hang | -ohang | -tag | -diag | -inset} [-width <string>] [-offset <string>] [-compact]
!           .Bl -column [-offset <string>] <string1> <string2> ...
!           .Bl {-item | -enum [-nested] | -bullet | -hyphen | -dash} [-offset <string>] [-compact]
!
!     And now a detailed description of the list types.
!
!     -bullet  A bullet list.
!
!                    .Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
!                    .It
!                    Bullet one goes here.
!                    .It
!                    Bullet two here.
!                    .El
!
!              Produces:
!
!                    o   Bullet one goes here.
!                    o   Bullet two here.
!
!     -dash (or -hyphen)
!              A dash list.
!
!                    .Bl -dash -offset indent -compact
!                    .It
!                    Dash one goes here.
!                    .It
!                    Dash two here.
!                    .El
!
!              Produces:
!
!                    -   Dash one goes here.
!                    -   Dash two here.
!
!     -enum    An enumerated list.
!
!                    .Bl -enum -offset indent -compact
!                    .It
!                    Item one goes here.
!                    .It
!                    And item two here.
!                    .El
!
!              The result:
!
!                    1.   Item one goes here.
!                    2.   And item two here.
!
!              If you want to nest enumerated lists, use the -nested flag (starting with the second-level list):
!
!                    .Bl -enum -offset indent -compact
!                    .It
!                    Item one goes here

!     -column  This list type generates multiple columns.  The number of columns and the width of each column is determined by
!              the arguments to the -column list, <string1>, <string2>, etc.  If <stringN> starts with a `.' (dot) immediately
!              followed by a valid -mdoc macro name, interpret <stringN> and use the width of the result.  Otherwise, the width
!              of <stringN> (typeset with a fixed-width font) is taken as the Nth column width.
!
!              Each `.It' argument is parsed to make a row, each column within the row is a separate argument separated by a tab
!              or the `.Ta' macro.

!     -width <string>   If <string> starts with a `.' (dot) immediately followed by a valid -mdoc macro name, interpret <string>
!                       and use the width of the result.  Almost all lists in this document use this option.
!
!                       Example:

!
!                       (Note that the current state of -mdoc is saved before <string> is interpreted; afterwards, all variables
!                       are restored again.  However, boxes (used for enclosures) can't be saved in GNU troff(1); as a conse-
!                       quence, arguments must always be balanced to avoid nasty errors.  For example, do not write `.Ao Ar
!                       string' but `.Ao Ar string Xc' instead if you really need only an opening angle bracket.)
!
!                       Otherwise, if <string> is a valid numeric expression (with a scale indicator other than `u'), use that
!                       value for indentation.  The most useful scale indicators are `m' and `n', specifying the so-called Em and
!                       En square.  This is approximately the width of the letters `m' and `n' respectively of the current font
!                       (for nroff output, both scale indicators give the same values).  If <string> isn't a numeric expression,
!                       it is tested whether it is an -mdoc macro name, and the default width value associated with this macro is
!                       used.  Finally, if all tests fail, the width of <string> (typeset with a fixed-width font) is taken as
!                       the width.
!
!                       If a width is not specified for the tag list type, every time `.It' is invoked, an attempt is made to
!                       determine an appropriate width.  If the first argument to `.It' is a callable macro, the default width
!                       for that macro will be used; otherwise, the default width of `.No' is used.
!
!     -offset <string>  If <string> is indent, a default indent value (normally set to 6n, similar to the value used in `.Dl' or
!                       `.Bd') is used.  If <string> is a valid numeric expression instead (with a scale indicator other than
!                       `u'), use that value for indentation.  The most useful scale indicators are `m' and `n', specifying the
!                       so-called Em and En square.  This is approximately the width of the letters `m' and `n' respectively of
!                       the current font (for nroff output, both scale indicators give the same values).  If <string> isn't a
!                       numeric expression, it is tested whether it is an -mdoc macro name, and the default offset value associ-
!                       ated with this macro is used.  Finally, if all tests fail, the width of <string> (typeset with a fixed-
!                       width font) is taken as the offset.

!MISCELLANEOUS MACROS
!     Here a list of the remaining macros which do not fit well into one of the above sections.  We couldn't find real examples
!     for the following macros: `.Me' and `.Ot'.  They are documented here for completeness - if you know how to use them prop-
!     erly please send a mail to bug-groff@gnu.org (including an example).
!
!     .Bt  prints
!
!                is currently in beta test.
!
!          It is neither callable nor parsed and takes no arguments.
!
!     .Fr
!
!                Usage: .Fr <function return value> ...
!
!          Don't use this macro.  It allows a break right before the return value (usually a single digit) which is bad typo-
!          graphical behaviour.  Use `\~' to tie the return value to the previous word.
!
!     .Hf  Use this macro to include a (header) file literally.  It first prints `File:' followed by the file name, then the con-
!          tents of <file>.
!
!                Usage: .Hf <file>
!
!          It is neither callable nor parsed.
!
!     .Lk  To be written.
!
!     .Me  Exact usage unknown.  The documentation in the -mdoc source file describes it as a macro for ``menu entries''.
!
!          Its default width is 6n.
!
!     .Mt  To be written.
!
!     .Ot  Exact usage unknown.  The documentation in the -mdoc source file describes it as ``old function type (fortran)''.
!
!     .Sm  Activate (toggle) space mode.
!
!                Usage: .Sm [on | off] ...

!
!PREDEFINED STRINGS
!     The following strings are predefined:
!
!     String   Nroff      Troff      Meaning
!     <=       <=         <=         less equal
!     >=       >=         >=         greater equal
!     Rq       ''         ''         right double quote
!     Lq       ``         ``         left double quote
!
!     ua       ^          ^          upwards arrow
!     aa       '          '          acute accent
!     ga       `          `          grave accent
!     q        "          "          straight double quote
!     Pi       pi         pi         greek pi
!     Ne       !=         !=         not equal
!     Le       <=         <=         less equal
!     Ge       >=         >=         greater equal
!     Lt       <          <          less than
!     Gt       >          >          greater than
!     Pm       +-         +-         plus minus
!     If       infinity   infinity   infinity
!     Am       &          &          ampersand
!     Na       NaN        NaN        not a number
!     Ba       |          |          vertical bar
!
!     The names of the columns Nroff and Troff are a bit misleading; Nroff shows the ASCII representation, while Troff gives the
!     best glyph form available.  For example, a Unicode enabled TTY-device will have proper glyph representations for all
!     strings, whereas the enhancement for a Latin1 TTY-device is only the plus-minus sign.
!
!     String names which consist of two characters can be written as `\*(xx'; string names which consist of one character can be
!     written as `\*x'.  A generic syntax for a string name of any length is `\*[xxx]' (this is a GNU troff(1) extension).
!
!DIAGNOSTICS
!     The debugging macro `.Db' available in previous versions of -mdoc has been removed since GNU troff(1) provides better
!     facilities to check parameters; additionally, many error and warning messages have been added to this macro package, making
!     it both more robust and verbose.
!
!     The only remaining debugging macro is `.Rd' which yields a register dump of all global registers and strings.  A normal
!     user will never need it.
!
!FORMATTING WITH GROFF, TROFF, AND NROFF
!     By default, the package inhibits page breaks, headers, and footers if displayed with a TTY device like `latin1' or
!     `unicode', to make the manual more efficient for viewing on-line.  This behaviour can be changed (e.g. to create a hardcopy
!     of the TTY output) by setting the register `cR' to zero while calling groff(1), resulting in multiple pages instead of a
!     single, very long page:
!
!           groff -Tlatin1 -rcR=0 -mdoc foo.man > foo.txt
!
!     For double-sided printing, set register `D' to 1:
!
!           groff -Tps -rD1 -mdoc foo.man > foo.ps
!
!     To change the document font size to 11pt or 12pt, set register `S' accordingly:
!
!           groff -Tdvi -rS11 -mdoc foo.man > foo.dvi
!
!     Register `S' is ignored for TTY devices.
!
!     The line and title length can be changed by setting the registers `LL' and `LT', respectively:
!
!           groff -Tutf8 -rLL=100n -rLT=100n -mdoc foo.man | less
!
!     If not set, both registers default to 78n for TTY devices and 6.5i otherwise.
!
!FILES
!     doc.tmac          The main manual macro package.
!     mdoc.tmac         A wrapper file to call doc.tmac.
!     mdoc/doc-common   Common strings, definitions, stuff related typographic output.
!     mdoc/doc-nroff    Definitions used for a TTY output device.
!     mdoc/doc-ditroff  Definitions used for all other devices.
!     mdoc.local        Local additions and customizations.
!     andoc.tmac        Use this file if you don't know whether the -mdoc or the -man package should be used.  Multiple man pages
!                       (in either format) can be handled.

!
!BUGS
!     Section 3f has not been added to the header routines.
!
!     `.Nm' font should be changed in NAME section.
!
!     `.Fn' needs to have a check to prevent splitting up if the line length is too short.  Occasionally it separates the last
!     parenthesis, and sometimes looks ridiculous if a line is in fill mode.
!
!     The list and display macros do not do any keeps and certainly should be able to.

!
! DESCRIPTION
!
! The ronn(1) command converts text in a simple markup to UNIX manual pages. The
!  syntax includes all Markdown formatting features, plus conventions for
!  expressing the structure and various notations present in standard UNIX
!  manpages.
!
! Not all roff(7) typesetting features can be expressed using ronn syntax.
!
! MANPAGE TITLE
!
! Manpages have a name, section, and a one-line description. Files must start with
! a level one heading defining these attributes:
! ls(1) -- list directory contents
! ================================
!
! Indicates that the manpage is named ls in manual section 1 ("user commands").
!
! SECTION HEADINGS
!
! Man section headings are expressed with markdown level two headings. There are
! two syntaxes for level two headings.
!
! Hash prefix syntax:
! ## HEADING TEXT
!
! Dash underline syntax:
! HEADING TEXT
! ------------
!
! Section headings should be all uppercase and may not contain inline markup.
!
! INLINE MARKUP
!
! Manpages have a limited set of text formatting capabilities. There's basically
! boldface and italics (often displayed using underline). Ronn uses the following
! bits of markdown(7) to accomplish this:
!   `backticks` (markdown compatible)
!   Code, flags, commands, and noun-like things; typically displayed in
!   boldface. All text included within backticks is displayed literally; other
!   inline markup is not processed. HTML output: <code>.
!   **double-stars** (markdown compatible)
!   Also displayed in boldface. Unlike backticks, inline markup is processed. HTML
!   output: <strong>.
!   <anglequotes> (non-compatible markdown extension)
!   User-specified arguments, variables, or user input. Typically displayed with
!   underline in roff output. HTML output: <var/>.
!   _underbars_ (markdown compatible)
!   Emphasis. May be used for literal option values. Typically displayed with
!   underline in roff output. HTML output: <em>.
!
! Here is grep(1)'s DESCRIPTION section represented in ronn:
! `Grep` searches the named input <FILE> (or standard input if
! no files are named, or the file name `-` is given) for lines
! containing a match to the given <PATTERN>. By default, `grep`
! prints the matching lines.
!
! DEFINITION LISTS
!
! The definition list syntax is compatible with markdown's unordered list syntax
!  but requires that the first line of each list item be terminated with a colon
!  ":" character. The contents of the first line is the term; subsequent lines may
! be comprised of multiple paragraphs, code blocks, standard lists, and nested
!  definition lists.
!
! An example definition list, taken from BSD test(1)'s DESCRIPTION section:
!  The following primaries are used to construct expressions:
!
!    * `-b` <file>:
!      True if <file> exists and is a block special file.
!
!    * `-c` <file>:
!      True if _file_ exists and is a character special file.
!
!    * `-d` <file>:
!      True if file exists and is a directory.
!
! LINKS
!
! All markdown(7) linking features are supported.
!
! Markdown reference-style links can be used to link to specific sections by name:
! ## SECTION 1
!
! See the following section.
!
! ## SECTION 2
!
! See [SECTION 1][] or [to put it another way][SECTION 1].
!
! The anchor name would be #SECTION-1 and #SECTION-2. All non-word characters are
! removed and spaces are replaced by dashes.
