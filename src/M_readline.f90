!!##NAME
!!      M_readline(3fm) - [M_readline::INTRO] Calling readline(3c) from Fortran
!!      (LICENSE:PD)
!!##SYNOPSIS
!!
!!      Use M_readline, only : system_readline
!!##DESCRIPTION
!!
!!    The M_readline(3fm) module uses the ISO_C_BINDING module to create a
!!    binding to the GNU readline(3c) procedure from Fortran programs.
!!
!!##EXAMPLE
!!
!!
!!    The test program is basically just a read loop that prompts for
!!    lines of input read with readline(3c). You can edit the line being
!!    read with readline(3c) per its documentation. At a minimum, you can
!!    probably move around the line with the left and right arrow keys, and
!!    insert characters by typing them wherever you moved the cursor to,
!!    and use the DEL/ RUBOUT key to delete characters and such. If you use
!!    a GNU/1 shell with command line editing, you are probably familiar
!!    with readline(3c)'s function.
!!
!!    It quits if you enter 'q' on an input line, and it dumps the history if
!!    you enter 'h'.
!!
!!   the test program
!!
!!    program demo_M_readline
!!       use M_readline
!!       implicit none
!!       character(len=256):: line
!!       integer                       :: cstat
!!       character(len=256)            :: sstat
!!
!!       write(*,*)' ____________________________________________________________'
!!       write(*,*)'  Your input lines are now editable using the GNU'
!!       write(*,*)'  readline(3C) procedure. By default, up-arrow and'
!!       write(*,*)'  down-arrow go thru the history lines; left and right arrow'
!!       write(*,*)'  keys and delete and just typing characters let you do'
!!       write(*,*)'  simple editing. Far more input control is available.'
!!       write(*,*)'  See the browser pages and man(1) pages for readline(3c).'

!!
!!       do
!!          call system_readline(line,'readline>') ! read editable input line
!!          if(line.eq.'q') stop
!!          !call system(trim(line))    ! common extension
!!          call execute_command_line(trim(line),cmdstat=cstat,cmdmsg=sstat) ! f08 equivalent
