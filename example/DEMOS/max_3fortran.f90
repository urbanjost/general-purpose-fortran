        ! elemental
         ! there must be at least two arguments, so even if A1 is an array
         ! max(A1) is not valid. See MAXVAL(3) and/or MAXLOC(3) instead.

         ! strings in a single array do need to be of the same length
         ! but the different objects can still be of different lengths.
         write(*,"(*('""',a,'""':,1x))")MAX(['A','Z'],['BB','Y '])
         ! note the result is now an array with the max of every element
         ! position, as can be illustrated numerically as well:
         write(*,'(a,*(i3,1x))')'box=   ',box
         write(*,'(a,*(i3,1x))')'box**2=',sign(1,box)*box**2
         write(*,'(a,*(i3,1x))')'max    ',max(box,sign(1,box)*box**2)

         ! Remember if any argument is an array by the definition of an
         ! elemental function all the array arguments must be the same shape.

         ! to find the single largest value of arrays you could use something
         ! like MAXVAL([arr1, arr2]) or probably better (no large temp array),
         ! max(maxval(arr1),maxval(arr2)) instead

         ! so this returns an array of the same shape as any input array
         ! where each result is the maximum that occurs at that position.
         write(*,*)max(arr1,arr2(1:4))
         ! this returns an array just like arr1 except all values less than
         ! zero are set to zero:
         write(*,*)max(box,0)
         ! When mixing arrays and scalars you can think of the scalars
         ! as being a copy of one of the arrays with all values set to
         ! the scalar value.
